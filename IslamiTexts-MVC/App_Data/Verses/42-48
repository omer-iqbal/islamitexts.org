  "en_tr_yusuf": "If then they run away, We have not sent thee as a guard over them. Thy duty is but to convey (the Message). And truly, when We give man a taste of a Mercy from Ourselves, he doth exult thereat, but when some ill happens to him, on account of the deeds which his hands have sent forth, truly then is man ungrateful!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "But if they are averse, We have not sent thee as a warder over them. Thine is only to convey (the message). And lo! when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us he exulteth therefor. And if some evil striketh them because of that which their own hands have sent before, then lo! man is an ingrate.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "But if they turn aside, We have not sent you as a watcher over them; on you is only to deliver (the message); and surely when We make man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices thereat; and if an evil afflicts them on account of what their hands have already done, then-surely man is ungrateful.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "But if they turn away (O Muhammad SAW from the Islamic Monotheism, which you have brought to them). We have not sent you (O Muhammad SAW) as a Hafiz (protector) over them (i.e. to take care of their deeds and to recompense them). Your duty is to convey (the Message). And verily, when We cause man to taste of Mercy from Us, he rejoices thereat, but when some ill befalls them because of the deeds which their hands have sent forth, then verily, man (becomes) ingrate!",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "If then they turn away, then We have not sent thee to be a warden over them, on thee is naught but preaching. And verily We! when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us he exulteth thereat; and if an ill befalleth them because of that which their hands have sent on, then verily man becometh ingrate.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "But if they turn away, We have not sent you (Prophet Muhammad) to be their (compulsory) guardian. It is only for you to deliver (the Message). When We give the human a taste of Our Mercy, he rejoices because of it; but when, because of what he has earned, evil befalls him, the human is ungrateful.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "But if they turn away, then We have not sent thee as a guard over them; thine is only to deliver the Message. And when We let man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; and if some evil befalls them because of what their hands have forwarded, then surely man is unthankful.",
  "en_tr_sher": "But if they turn away, We have not sent thee as a guardian over them. Thy duty is only to convey the Message. And truly when We cause man to taste of mercy from Us, he rejoice therein. But if an evil befalls them because of what their hands have sent forth, then lo! man is ungrateful.",
  "en_tr_asad": "BUT IF they turn away [from thee, O Prophet, know that] We have not sent thee to be their keeper: thou art not bound to do more than deliver the message [entrusted to thee]. \nAnd, behold, [such as turn away from Our messages are but impelled by the weakness and inconstancy of human nature: thus,] when We give man a taste of Our grace, he is prone to exult in it; but if misfortune befalls [any of] them in result of what their own hands have sent forth, then, behold, man shows how bereft he is of all gratitude!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "But if they turn away, We sent thee not to be a guardian over them. It is for thee only to deliver the Message. And when We let man taste mercy from Us, he rejoices in it; but if some evil befalls him for that his own hands have forwarded, then surely man is unthankful.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "(O Prophet), if they turn away from the Truth, know that We did not send you to them as their overseer.{{74}} Your task is only to convey (the Message). Indeed when We give man a taste of Our Mercy, he exults in it. But if any misfortune afflicts them on account of their deeds, man is utterly ungrateful.{{75}}",

On the other hand, when they are in trouble, due to their own errors and shortcomings, they fall into despair and blame Allah, instead of blaming themselves. This is rank ingratitude.
