Since self-surrender to God is the basis of all true belief, some of the greatest commentators (e.g., Zamakhshari, Razi) hold that the address, \"O you who have attained to faith\" cannot refer here to Muslims - a designation which, throughout the Qur'an, literally means \"those who have surrendered themselves to God\" - but must relate to people who have not yet achieved such complete self-surrender: that is, to the Jews and the Christians, who do believe in most of the earlier revelations but do not regard the message of the Qur'an as true. This interpretation would seem to be borne out by the subsequent passages."
