Moreover, the Qur'an states in many places that whereas this particular ancestor of the Hebrews - and, by the way, of most of the Arab tribes as well - was a personification of all that is good and upright, so that \"God exalted him with His love\" (4:125), his Jewish descendants always tended to rebel against God and, thus, \"persistently wronged themselves\"."
