The \"brethren\" of the children of Israel are obviously the Arabs, and particularly the musta'ribah (\"Arabianized\") group among them, which traces its descent to Ishmael and Abraham: and since it is to this group that the Arabian Prophet's own tribe, the Quraysh, belonged, the above Biblical passages must be taken as referring to his advent."
