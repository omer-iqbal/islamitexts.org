Just as mankind was chosen collectively to be Vicegerents for Allah, and yet some among mankind fell into evil-even so, some in the house of Islam fail to follow the Light given to them, and thus \"wrong their own souls\".

Then there is a third class: they may not indeed be perfect, but both their intentions and their conduct are sound, and they form an example to other men: they are \"foremost\" in every good deed. They are so, not by their own merits, but by the Grace of Allah. And they have reached the highest Achievement-the salvation, which is typified by the various metaphors that follow."
