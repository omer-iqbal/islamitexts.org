Sodom and Gomorrah were in a tract of hard, caky, sulphurous soil, to which this description well applies. Cf. 51:33, where the words are \"stones of clay\" (hijarah min tin) in connection with the same incident. On the other hand, in 105:4, the word Sijjil is used for pellets of hard-baked clay in connection with Abraha and the Companions of the Elephant."

Qamus and Taj al-'Arus. If this supposition is correct, the \"stones of petrified clay\" would be more or less synonymous with \"brimstones\", which in its turn would point to a volcanic eruption, probably in conjunction with a severe earthquake (alluded to in the preceding phrase, \"We turned those [sinful towns] upside down\"). But there is also a strong probability, pointed out by Zamakhshari and Razi, that the term sijjil is of purely Arabic origin - namely, a synonym of sijjil, which primarily signifies \"a writing\", and secondarily, \"something that has been decreed\": in which case the expression hijarah min sijjil can be understood in a metaphorical sense, namely, as \"stones of all the chastisement laid down in God's decree\" (Zamakhshari and Razi, both in conjunction with the above verse and in their commentaries on 105:4). It is, I believe, this metaphorical meaning of \"stone-hard blows of chastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., of God-willed doom, that the concluding sentence of the next verse alludes to."
