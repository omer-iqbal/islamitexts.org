  "ar_text_clean": "فمن يرد الله أن يهديه يشرح صدره للإسلام ومن يرد أن يضله يجعل صدره ضيقا حرجا كأنما يصعد في السماء كذلك يجعل الله الرجس على الذين لا يؤمنون",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide,- He openeth their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And whomsoever it is Allah's will to guide, He expandeth his bosom unto the Surrender, and whomsoever it is His Will to send astray, He maketh his bosom close and narrow as if he were engaged in sheer ascent. Thus Allah layeth ignominy upon those who believe not.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Therefore (for) whomsoever Allah intends that He would guide him aright, He expands his breast for Islam, and (for) whomsoever He intends that He should cause him to err, He makes his breast strait and narrow as though he were ascending upwards; thus does Allah lay uncleanness on those who do not believe.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast to Islam, and whomsoever He wills to send astray, He makes his breast closed and constricted, as if he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allah puts the wrath on those who believe not.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "So whomsoever Allah willeth that he shall guide, He expoundeth his breast for Islam; and whomsoever He willeth that he shall send astray, He maketh his breast strait, narrow, as if he were mounting up into the sky, thus Allah layeth the abomination on those who believe not.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Whomsoever Allah desires to guide, He expands his chest to Islam (submission). Whomsoever He desires to lead astray, He makes his chest narrow, tight, as though he were climbing to heaven. As such Allah lays the scourge on the unbelievers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Now, whomso God desires to guide, He opens his breast to Submission (Islam), and whomso He desires to send astray, He makes his breast narrow and tight, as if he were going up in the heaven; thus God lays abomination on those who believe not.",
  "en_tr_sher": "So, whomsoever God intends to guide, He expands his bosom for the acceptance of Islam; and whomsoever He intends that he should go astray, He makes his bosom narrow and close, as though he was mounting up into the skies. Thus does God inflict punishment on those who do not believe.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And whomsoever God wills to guide, his bosom He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]; and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, his bosom He causes to be tight and constricted, as if he were climbing unto the skies: it is thus that God inflicts horror upon those who will not believe.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Whomsoever God desires to guide, He expands his breast to Islam; whomsoever He desires to lead astray, He makes his breast narrow, tight, as if he were climbing to heaven. So God lays abomination upon those who believe not.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Thus, (it is a fact that) whomsoever Allah wills to guide, He opens his breast for Islam;{{92}} and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, He causes his breast to become strait and constricted, as if he were climbing towards the heaven. Thus Allah lays the abomination (of flight from and hatred of Islam) on those who do not believe",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Those whom Allah (in His plan) willeth to guide,- He openeth{{947}} their breast to Islam; those whom He willeth to leave straying,- He maketh their breast close and constricted, as if they had to climb up to the skies: thus doth Allah (heap) the penalty on those who refuse to believe.",
  "en_ctr_asad": "And whomsoever God wills to guide, his bosom He opens wide with willingness towards self-surrender [unto Him]; and whomsoever He wills to let go astray, his bosom He causes to be tight and constricted, as if he were climbing unto the skies: it is thus that God inflicts horror upon those who will not believe.",

      "note": "Allah's Universal Plan is the Qada wa Qadr, which is so much misunderstood. That Plan is unalterable, and that is His Will. It means that in the spiritual world, as in the physical world, there are laws of justice, mercy, grace, penalty, etc., which work as surely as anything we know. If, then, a man refuses Faith, becomes a rebel, with each step he goes further and further down, and his pace will be accelerated; he will scarcely be able to take spiritual breath, and his recovery-in spite of Allah's mercy which he has rejected-will be as difficult as if he had to climb up to the skies. On the other hand, the godly will find, with each step, the next step easier. Jesus expressed this truth paradoxically: \"He that hath, to him shall be given; but he that hath not, from him shall be taken away even that which he hath\": Mark. 4:25. John (6:65) makes Jesus say: \"No man can come unto me, except it were given unto him of my Father.\""
