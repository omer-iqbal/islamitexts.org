      "note": "Salsal: dry clay which produces a sound, like pottery, Cf. 55:14. Taking verses 26 and 29 together, I understand the meaning to be: that man's body was formed from wet clay moulded into shape and then dried until it could emit sound (perhaps referring to speech); that it was then further fashioned and completed; that into the animal form thus fashioned was breathed the Spirit of Allah, which gave it a superiority over other Creation: and that the order for obeisance was then given."

      "note": "There are many references in the Qur'an to man's having been \"created out of clay (tin)\" or \"out of dust (turab)\", both these terms signifying man's lowly biological origins as well as the fact that his body is composed of various organic and inorganic substances existing - in other combinations or in their elementary forms - on or in the earth. The term salsal, occurring in three verses of this surah as well as in 55:14, adds a further dimension to this concept. According to most of the philological authorities, it denotes \"dried clay that emits a sound\" (i.e., when it is struck); and since it is used in the Qur'an exclusively with reference to the creation of man, it seems to contain an allusion to the power of articulate speech which distinguishes man from all other animal species, as well as to the brittleness of his existence (cf. the expression \"like pottery\" in 55:14). As the construction of the sentence shows, this salsal is stated to have evolved (Razi) out of hama' - which, according to some authorities, is the plural of ham'ah, signifying \"dark, fetid mud\" or \"dark slime\" - while the participial adjective masnun which qualifies this noun denotes, as Razi points out, both \"altered\" (i.e., in its composition) and \"brought into shape\": hence my rendering of this expression as \"transmuted\", which to some extent combines both of the above meanings. To my mind, we have here a description of the primeval biological environment out of which the \"sounding clay\" - the matrix, as it were - of man's physical body has evolved in acccordance with God's plan of creation."
