      "note": "The \"bond with God\" (conventionally translated as \"God's covenant\") apparently refers here to man's moral obligation to use his inborn gifts - intellectual as well as physical - in the way intended for them by God. The \"establishment\" of this bond arises from the faculty of reason which, if properly used, must lead man to a realization of his own weakness and dependence on a causative power and, thus, to a gradual cognition of God's will with reference to his own behaviour. This interpretation of the \"bond with God\" seems to be indicated by the fact that there is no mention of any specific \"covenant\" in either the preceding or the subsequent verses of the passage under consideration. The deliberate omission of any explanatory reference in this connection suggests that the expression \"bond with God\" stands for something that is rooted in the human situation as such, and can, therefore, be perceived instinctively as well as through conscious experience: namely, that innate relationship with God which makes Him \"closer to man than his neck-vein\" (50:16). For an explanation of the subsequent reference to \"what God has bidden to be joined\", see surah 13, note 43."
