      "note": "There is difference of opinion as to the exact interpretation of this verse. The words are: The Jews did not kill Jesus, but Allah raised him up (rafa'ahu) to Himself. One school holds that Jesus did not die the usual human death, but still lives in the body in heaven, which is the generally accepted Muslim view. Another holds that he did die (5:117) but not when he was supposed to be crucified, and that his being \"raised up\" unto Allah means that instead of being disgraced as a malefactor, as the Jews intended, he was on the contrary honoured by Allah as His Messenger: (see 4:159). The same word rafa'a is used in association with honour in connection with al Mustafa in 94:4. (R)."

      "note": "Cf. 3:55, where God says to Jesus, \"Verily, I shall cause thee to die, and shall exalt thee unto Me.\" The verb rafa ahu (lit., \"he raised him\" or \"elevated him\") has always, whenever the act of raf (\"elevating\") of a human being is attributed to God, the meaning of \"honouring\" or \"exalting\". Nowhere in the Qur'an is there any warrant for the popular belief that God has \"taken up\" Jesus bodily, in his lifetime, into heaven. The expression \"God exalted him unto Himself in the above verse denotes the elevation of Jesus to the realm of God's special grace - a blessing in which all prophets partake, as is evident from 19:57, where the verb rafa nahu (\"We exalted him\") is used with regard to the Prophet Idris. (See also Muhammad 'Abduh in Manar III, 316 f., and VI, 20 f.) The \"nay\" (bal) at the beginning of the sentence is meant to stress the contrast between the belief of the Jews that they had put Jesus to a shameful death on the cross and the fact of God's having \"exalted him unto Himself."
