  "en_tr_sher": "And remember when at the time of your encounter, He made them appear to you as few in your eyes, and made you appear as few in their eyes, that God might bring about the thing that was decreed. And to God are all affairs referred for final decision.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And so, when you met in battle, He made them appear as few in your eyes &ndash; just as He made you appear as of little account in their eyes &ndash; so that God might accomplish a thing [which He willed] to be done: for all things go back to God [as their source].",

Even though they thought the Muslim force was twice as great as it was (3:13), still that number was contemptible, when taken with its poor equipment. Both these psychological mistakes subserved the Plan, which was to bring the matter to a decisive issue, whether the Pagans of Makkah were to continue their arrogant oppression, or the religion of Allah was to be established in freedom and honour."

Since at the time of the actual encounter the Muslims could no longer be in doubt as to the great number of the enemy force, the phrase \"He made them appear as few in your eyes\" has obviously a metaphorical meaning: it implies that, by that time, the Prophet's followers were so full of courage that the enemy appeared insignificant to them. The Quraysh, on the other hand, were so conscious of their own power and numerical superiority that the Muslims appeared but of little account to them - a mistake which ultimately cost them the battle and a great number of lives."
