Tropically, it connotes the act of \"establishing\" or \"determining\" a thing, a proposition, a course of events, etc. (Jawhari). According to the Lisan al-Arab, the phrase abrama al-amr has the meaning of \"he determined (ahkama) the case\". In the present context, the term amr, having no definite article, signifies \"anything\" or - in its widest sense - \"anything that should [or \"could\"] be\": and so, taking the preceding verse into account, we arrive at the meaning of arbitrarily \"determining what [the truth] should be\" - i.e., in contradiction to what the Qur'an postulates as the truth."
