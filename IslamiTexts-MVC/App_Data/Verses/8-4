According to Razi, however, the \"most excellent sustenance\" is a metonym for \"the spiritual raptures arising from the knowledge of God, the love of Him, and the self-immersion (istighraq) in worshipping Him\". In Razi's interpretation, this expression refers to the spiritual reward of faith in this world. Some commentators (cf. Manar IX, 597) regard the above definition of true believers as the most important passage of this surah. - The phrase rendered by me as \"theirs shall be great dignity\" reads, literally, \"they shall have degrees\", 'namely, of excellence and dignity."
