  "en_tr_yusuf": "Thus did We make their case known to the people, that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour of Judgment. Behold, they dispute among themselves as to their affair. (Some) said, \"Construct a building over them\": Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, \"Let us surely build a place of worship over them.\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And in like manner We disclosed them (to the people of the city) that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that, as for the Hour, there is no doubt concerning it. When (the people of the city) disputed of their case among themselves, they said: Build over them a building; their Lord knoweth best concerning them. Those who won their point said: We verily shall build a place of worship over them.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And thus did We make (men) to get knowledge of them that they might know that Allah's promise is true and that as for the hour there is no doubt about it. When they disputed among themselves about their affair and said: Erect an edifice over them-- their Lord best knows them. Those who prevailed in their affair said: We will certainly raise a masjid over them.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And thus We made their case known to the people, that they might know that the Promise of Allah is true, and that there can be no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when they (the people of the city) disputed among themselves about their case, they said: \"Construct a building over them, their Lord knows best about them,\" (then) those who won their point said (most probably the disbelievers): \"We verily shall build a place of worship over them.\"",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And likewise We caused their affair to be lit upon that they might know that the promise of Allah is true, and that the Hour-there is no doubt thereof, Recall what time they were disputing among themselves regarding their affair, and then they said: build over them a building--their Lord is the Best Knower about them-then those who prevailed in their affair said: surely we will raise over them a place of worship.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "And so We made them (the unbelievers) stumble upon them, so that they might know that the promise of Allah is true and that there is no doubt about theHour. They argued among themselves over their affair, then (the unbelievers) said: 'Build a building over them (their remains). Their Lord knows best who they were. 'But those who prevailed over the matter said; 'We will build around them a Mosque. '",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And, like that, We made them known to people, that they might know that God's promise is true and that there is no doubt regarding the Hour. When they were contending among them their affair they said, `build over them a building.' Their Lord knew them best. Those who prevailed over their affair said, `We will raise a place of worship over them'.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And thus did We disclose them to the people that they might know that the promise of God was true, and that, as to the promised Hour, there was no doubt about it. And call to mind the time when people disputed among themselves concerning them, and said to each other, 'Build over them a building.' Their Lord knew them best. 'We will, surely, build a place of worship over them.'",
  "en_tr_asad": "AND IN THIS way have We drawn [people's] attention to their story, so that they might know &ndash; whenever they debate among themselves as to what happened to those [Men of the Cave] &ndash; that God's promise [of resurrection] is true, and that there can be no doubt as to [the coming of] the Last Hour.\nAnd so, some [people] said: \"Erect a building in their memory; their Sustainer knows best what happened to them.\" Said they whose opinion prevailed in the end: \"Indeed, we must surely raise a house of worship in their memory!\"",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And even so We made them stumble upon them, that they might know that Gods promise is true, and that the Hour -- there is no doubt of it. When they were contending among themselves of their affair then they said, Build over them a building; their Lord knows of them very well. Said those who prevailed over their affair, We will raise over them a place of worship.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Thus did We make their case known to the people of the city{{17}} so that they might know that Allah's promise is true, and that there is absolutely no doubt that the Hour will come to pass.{{18}} But instead of giving thought to this, they disputed with one another concerning the People of the Cave, some saying: \"Build a wall over them.{{19}} Their Lord alone knows best about them.\" But those who prevailed over their affairs{{20}} said: \"We shall build a place of worship over them.\"{{21}}",

(Some) said, \"Construct a building over them\": Their Lord knows best about them: those who prevailed over their affair said, \"Let us surely build a place of worship over them.\"",
  "en_ctr_asad": "AND IN THIS way{{27}} have We drawn [people's] attention to their story,{{28}} so that they might know - whenever they debate among themselves as to what happened to those [Men of Cave]{{29}} - that God's promise [of resurrection] is true, and that there can be no doubt as to [the coming of] the Last Hour. And so, some [people] said: \"Erect a building in their memory;{{30}} God knows best what happened to them.\" Said they whose opinion prevailed in the end: \"Indeed, we must surely raise a house of worship in their memory!\"",

His old-fashioned dress, appearance, and speech, and the old uncurrent money which he brought, at once drew the attention of people to him. When they learnt his story, they realised that Allah, who can protect His servants thus and raise them up from sleep after such a long time, has power to raise up men for the Resurrection, and that His promise of goodness and mercy to those who serve Him is true and was exemplified in this striking way. On the other hand, to the men of the Cave themselves, it became clear that Allah can change the situation before we are aware, and our hope in Him is not futile, and that even when we are on the bring of despair, a revolution is surely working in the world before the world itself realises it."

The Sleepers could not judge about the duration of their stay in the Cave, but they wisely left the matter and attended to the urgent business of their lives. The townsfolk could not agree as to the significance of the event: they fell to discussing immaterial details. What sort of a memorial should they raise? - a house or a place of worship or a tablet? The place of worship was built. But the real significance of the spiritual meaning was missed until explained in the Qur'an."
