      "note": "The term sama' (\"heaven\" or \"sky\") is applied to anything that is spread like a canopy above any other thing. Thus, the visible skies which stretch like a vault above the earth and form, as it were, its canopy, are called sama: and this is the primary meaning of this term in the Qur'an; in a wider sense, it has the connotation of \"cosmic system\". As regards the \"seven heavens\", it is to be borne in mind that in Arabic usage - and apparently in other Semitic languages as well - the number \"seven\" is often synonymous with \"several\" (see Lisan al-Arab), just as \"seventy\" or \"seven hundred\" often means \"many\" or \"very many\" (Taj al-Arus). This, taken together with the accepted linguistic definition that \"every sama' is a sama' with regard to what is below it\" (Raghib), may explain the \"seven heavens\" as denoting the multiplicity of cosmic systems. - For my rendering of thumma, at the beginning of this sentence, as \"and\", see surah 7, first part of note 43."
