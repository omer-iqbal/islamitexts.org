While people with the foibles described in n. 5350 may be willing to spend \"something\" (small) in charity for a special consultation occasionally, they may be frightened of spending large sums when their needs for consultation may be numerous. What is to be done then? Are they to be shut out altogether? No. They are asked to be punctilious in the discharge of their normal duties of at least normal regular prayers and regular charity, \"if Allah forgives you\", i.e., if Allah's Messenger relieves them of further special contributions such as those noted in verse 12. This condition, \"if Allah forgives you\", provides the safeguard against the abuse of the privilege. The messenger would know in each case what is best for the individual and for the community."
