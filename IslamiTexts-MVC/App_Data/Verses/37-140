In its primary significance, the infinitive noun ibaq (derived from the verb abaqa) denotes \"a slave's running-away from his master\"; and Jonah is spoken of as having \"fled like a runaway slave\" because - although he was God's message-bearer - he abandoned his task under the stress of violent anger. The subsequent mention of \"the laden ship\" alludes to the central, allegorical part of Jonah's story. The ship ran into a storm and was about to founder; and the mariners \"said everyone to his fellow, Come and let us cast lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us\" (The Book of Jonah i, 7) - a procedure to which Jonah agreed."
