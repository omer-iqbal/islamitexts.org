Here was an unknown, unclaimed youth, of surpassing beauty, with apparently a mind as refined as was his external beauty.

They had indeed lighted upon a treasure! And they wanted to conceal him lest he was another's slave and had run away from his master who might come and claim him! The circumstances were peculiar and the merchants were cautious. Bida'ah - stock in trade: capital; money; wealth; treasure (Cf. 12:62)."
