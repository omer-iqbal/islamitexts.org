Ah! those who reject Allah will assuredly never prosper.\"",

(know) that the ungrateful are never successful.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And those who had desired (for a position like) his position the day before, began to say: \"Know you not that it is Allah Who enlarges the provision or restricts it to whomsoever He pleases of His slaves.
