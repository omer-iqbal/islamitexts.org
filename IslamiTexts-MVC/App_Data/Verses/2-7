Since it is God who has instituted all laws of nature - which, in their aggregate, are called sunnat Allah (\"the way of God\") - this \"sealing\" is attributed to Him: but it is obviously a consequence of man's free choice and not an act of \"predestination\". Similarly, the suffering which, in the life to come, is in store for those who during their life in this world have wilfully remained deaf and blind to the truth, is a natural consequence of their free choice - just as happiness in the life to come is the natural consequence of man's endeavour to attain to righteousness and inner illumination. It is in this sense that the Qur'anic references to God's \"reward\" and \"punishment\" must be understood."
