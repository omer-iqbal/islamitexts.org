As for the substance of God's decree, \"Be as apes despicable\", the famous tabi'i Mujahid explain it thus: \"[Only] their hearts were transformed, that is, they were not [really] transformed into apes: this is but a metaphor (mathal) coined by God with regard to them, similar to the metaphor of 'the ass carrying books' [62:5]\" (Tabari, in his commentary on 2:65; also Manar I, 343; VI, 448; and IX, 379). A similar explanation is given by Raghib. It should be borne in mind that the expression \"like an ape\" is often used in classical Arabic to describe a person who is unable to restrain his gross appetites or passions."
