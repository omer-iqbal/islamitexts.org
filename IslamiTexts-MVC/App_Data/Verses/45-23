  "en_tr_sher": "Hast thou considered the case of him who has taken his own low desire for his god, and whom God has adjudged as having gone astray on the basis of His perfect knowledge, and whose ears and whose heart He has sealed up, and on whose eyes He has put a covering.

Who, then, could guide him after God [has abandoned him]? Will you not, then, bethink yourselves?",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Hast thou seen him who has taken his caprice to be his god, and God has led him astray out of a knowledge, and set a seal upon his hearing and his heart, and laid a covering on his eyes? Who shall guide him after God? What, will you not remember?",
