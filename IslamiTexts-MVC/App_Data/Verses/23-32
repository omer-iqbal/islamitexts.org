But 1 think that as the name is not mentioned, we are to understand in general the type of post-Flood prophets until we come later on to Moses and Jesus. The object here is not to recount the stories, but to show that the resistance of the wicked made no difference to the triumph of Allah's Holy Truth."

Since, however, this passage contains elements appearing in the stories of many prophets - including that of the Prophet Muhammad - I am of the opinion that it has a general import: namely, an allusion to all of God's apostles and to the ever-recurring similarity of their experiences."
