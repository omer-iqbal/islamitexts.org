  "en_tr_yusuf": "He said: \"He says: A heifer not trained to till the soil or water the fields; sound and without blemish.\" They said: \"Now hast thou brought the truth.\" Then they offered her in sacrifice, but not with good-will.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "(Moses) answered: Lo! He saith: Verily she is a cow unyoked; she plougheth not the soil nor watereth the tilth; whole and without mark. They said: Now thou bringest the truth. So they sacrificed her, though almost they did not.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Musa said: He says, Surely she is a cow not made submissive that she should plough the land, nor does she irrigate the tilth; sound, without a blemish in her. They said: Now you have brought the truth; so they sacrificed her, though they had not the mind to do (it).",
  "en_tr_hilali": "He [Musa (Moses)] said, \"He says, 'It is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor water the fields, sound, having no other colour except bright yellow.' \" They said, \"Now you have brought the truth.\" So they slaughtered it though they were near to not doing it.",

  "en_tr_ayubk": "He said, `He says, she is a cow not broken to plough the earth, nor to water the tillage; sound, with no blemish on her.' They said, `now thou hast brought the truth.' Then they sacrificed her, though they hardly wanted to do it.",

  "en_tr_arberry": "He said, He says she shall be a cow not broken to plough the earth or to water the tillage, one kept secure, with no blemish on her. They said, Now thou hast brought the truth; and therefore they sacrificed her, a thing they had scarcely done.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Moses answered, \"Allah says that she should be a cow which has not been yoked nor has ploughed the land nor watered the fields; which is sound and whole, without blemish.\" Then they cried out, \"Now you have given an accurate description.\" Then they sacrificed her but they did not appear to be doing this willingly.{{84}}",

      "note": "I.e., their obstinate desire to obtain closer and closer definitions of the simple commandment revealed to them through Moses had made it almost impossible for them to fulfil it. In his commentary on this passage; Tabari quotes the following remark of Ibn 'Abbas: \"If [in the first instance] they had sacrificed any cow chosen by themselves, they would have fulfilled their duty; but they made it complicated for themselves, and so God made it complicated for them.\" A similar view has been expressed, in the same context, by Zamakhshari. It would appear that the moral of this story points to an important problem of all (and, therefore, also of Islamic) religious jurisprudence: namely, the inadvisability of trying to elicit additional details in respect of any religious law that had originally been given in general terms - for, the more numerous and multiform such details become, the more complicated and rigid becomes the law. This point has been acutely grasped by Rashid Rida, who says in his commentary on the above Qur'anic passage (see Manar I, 345 f.): \"Its lesson is that one should not pursue one's [legal] inquiries in such a way as to make laws more complicated ... This was how the early generations [of Muslims] visualized the problem. They did not make things complicated for themselves - and so, for them, the religious law (din) was natural, simple and liberal in its straightforwardness. But those who came later added to it [certain other] injunctions which they had deduced by means of their own reasoning (ijtihad); and they multiplied those [additional] injunctions to such an extent that the religious law became a heavy burden on the community.\" For the sociological reason why the genuine ordinances of Islamic Law - that is, those which have been prima facie laid down as such in the Qur'an and the teachings of the Prophet - are almost always devoid of details, I would refer the reader to my book State and Government in Islam (pp. 11 ff. and passim). The importance of this problem, illustrated in the above story of the cow - and correctly grasped by the Prophet's Companions - explains why this surah has been entitled \"The Cow\". (See also 5:101 and the corresponding notes 120-123.)"
