      "note": "The expression alladhina hajaru (lit., \"those who have forsaken their homelands\") denotes, primarily, the early Meccan Muslims who migrated at the Prophet's bidding to Medina - which was then called Yathrib - in order to be able to live in freedom and in accordance with the dictates of Islam. After the conquest of Mecca by the Muslims in the year 8 H., this exodus (hijrah) from Mecca to Medina ceased to be a religious obligation. Ever since the earliest days of Islam, however, the term hijrah has had a spiritual connotation as well-namely, a \"forsaking of the domain of evil\" and turning towards God: and since this spiritual connotation applies both to the historical muhajirun (\"emigrants\") of early Islam and to all believers of later times who forsake all that is sinful and \"migrate unto God\", I am using this expression frequently."
