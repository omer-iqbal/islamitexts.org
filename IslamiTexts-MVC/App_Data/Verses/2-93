  "en_tr_yusuf": "And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law)\": They said:\" We hear, and we disobey:\" And they had to drink into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness. Say: \"Vile indeed are the behests of your Faith if ye have any faith!\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And when We made with you a covenant and caused the Mount to tower above you, (saying): Hold fast by that which We have given you, and hear (Our Word), they said: We hear and we rebel. And (worship of) the calf was made to sink into their hearts because of their rejection (of the covenant). Say (unto them): Evil is that which your belief enjoineth on you, if ye are believers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And when We made a covenant with you and raised the mountain over you: Take hold of what We have given you with firmness and be obedient. They said: We hear and disobey.

  "en_tr_hilali": "And (remember) when We took your covenant and We raised above you the Mount (saying), \"Hold firmly to what We have given you and hear (Our Word). They said, \"We have heard and disobeyed.\" And their hearts absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of their disbelief. Say: \"Worst indeed is that which your faith enjoins on you if you are believers.\"",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And recall what time We took your bond and raised over you the Tur, saying: hold fast to that which We have vouchsafed unto you and hearken. They said: we hear and we disobey. And into their hearts the calf was made to sink because of their infidelity. Say thou: vile is that which your belief commandeth you, if ye are believers.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "When We made a covenant with you and raised the Mount above you (saying): 'Take what We have given you forcefully and hear, ' they replied: 'We hear, but disobey. ' For their disbelief, they were made to drink the calf into their very hearts. Say: 'Evil is your belief that orders you to (worship the calf), if you are indeed believers. '",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And when We made a covenant with you, and raised the Mount over you: `hold what We have given you firmly, and listen;' they said, `we listen and we disobey;' and their hearts were made to imbibe with (the love of) Calf because of their unbelief. Say, `evil is the thing your belief bids you to, if you are believers.'",
  "en_tr_sher": "And remember the time when We took a covenant from you and raised high above you the Mount, saying 'Hold firmly to what We have given you and hearken;' They said, 'We hear and we disobey;' and their hearts were saturated with the love of the calf because of their disbelieve. Say 'Evil is that which your faith enjoins on you if you are believers,'",
  "en_tr_asad": "And, lo, We accepted your solemn pledge, raising Mount Sinai high above you, [saying,] \"Hold fast with [all your] strength unto what We have vouchsafed you, and hearken unto it!\" \n[But] they say, \"We have heard, but we disobey\" &ndash; for their hearts are filled to overflowing with love of the [golden] calf because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth.\nSay: \"Vile is what this [false] belief of yours enjoins upon you &ndash; if indeed you are believers!\"",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And when We took compact with you, and raised over you the Mount: Take forcefully what We have given you and give ear. They said, We hear, and rebel; and they were made to drink the Calf in their hearts for their unbelief. Say: Evil is the thing your faith bids you to, if you are believers.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Recall also to mind the Covenant We made with you while We raised the Tur over you: `Follow strictly the precepts We are giving you and give ear to Our Commandments.' Your forefathers replied, \"We have heard but we will not obey.\" They were so prone to unbelief that they cherished the calf in their hearts. Tell them (O Muhammad). \"If indeed you are believers, yours is a strange Faith that enjoins you to do such evil things.\"",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "And remember We took your covenant and We raised above you (the towering height) of Mount (Sinai): (Saying): \"Hold firmly to what We have given you, and hearken (to the Law){{97}}\": They said:\" We hear, and we disobey{{98}}:\" And they had to drink{{99}} into their hearts (of the taint) of the calf because of their Faithlessness.
