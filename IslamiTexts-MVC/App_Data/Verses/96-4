It is impossible to produce in a Translation the complete orchestral harmony of the words for \"read\", \"teach\", \"pen\" (which implies reading, writing, books, study, research), \"knowledge\" (including science, self knowledge, spiritual understanding), and \"proclaim\", an alternative meaning of the word for \"to read\". This proclaiming or reading implies not only the duty of blazoning forth Allah's message, as going with the prophetic office, but also the duty of promulgation and wide dissemination of fhe Truth by all who read and understand it. The comprehensive meaning of qara' refers not only to a particular person and occasion but also gives a universal direction. And this kind of comprehensive meaning, as we have seen, runs throughout the Qur'an?for those who will understand."
