  "en_tr_yusuf": "Or (the Unbelievers' state) is like the depths of darkness in a vast deep ocean, overwhelmed with billow topped by billow, topped by (dark) clouds: depths of darkness, one above another: if a man stretches out his hands, he can hardly see it! for any to whom Allah giveth not light, there is no light!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Or as darkness on a vast, abysmal sea. There covereth him a wave, above which is a wave, above which is a cloud. Layer upon layer of darkness. When he holdeth out his hand he scarce can see it. And he for whom Allah hath not appointed light, for him there is no light.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Or like utter darkness in the deep sea: there covers it a wave above which is another wave, above which is a cloud, (layers of) utter darkness one above another; when he holds out his hand, he is almost unable to see it; and to whomsoever Allah does not give light, he has no light.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Or [the state of a disbeliever] is like the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed with a great wave topped by a great wave, topped by dark clouds, darkness, one above another, if a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly see it! And he for whom Allah has not appointed light, for him there is no light.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Or, like the darknesses in a sea deep; there covereth it a wave from above it, a wave from above it, above which is a cloud: darknesses one above anot her: when he putteth out his hand well-nigh he seeth it not. And upto whomsoever Allah shall not appoint a light, his shall be no light.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Or, they are like darkness upon a deep sea covered with a wave above which is another wave, above which are clouds, darkness piled one upon the other; when he stretches out his hand he can scarcely see it. Indeed, to whomsoever Allah assigns no light, he shall have no light.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Or (their works are) as darkness in a deep sea which a wave covers, above which is another wave, above which is a cloud; layers of darkness one above the other; when he puts forth his hand, he does not see it; and to whom God does not assign Light, there is no Light for him.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Or, their deeds are like thick layers of darkness spread over a vast and deep sea, on whose surface rise waves above waves, above which are clouds -- layers upon layers of darkness. When he holds out his hands, he can hardly see it; and he whom God gives no light -- for him there is no light at all.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Or [else, their deeds are] like the depths of darkness upon an abysmal sea, made yet more dark by wave billowing over wave, with [black] clouds above it all: depths of darkness, layer upon layer, [so that] when one holds up his hand, he can hardly see it: for he to whom God gives no light, no light whatever has he!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "or they are as shadows upon a sea obscure covered by a billow above which is a billow above which are clouds, shadows piled one upon another; when he puts forth his hand, wellnigh he cannot see it. And to whomsoever God assigns no light, no light has he.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Or (their efforts may be likened to those of a man trying to swim in) a deep dark ocean, covered with billows, one over the other, and above it a cloud: darkness upon darkness: so much so that if he stretches out his hand, he cannot see{{72}} it. There is no light for the one whom Allah does not give light. {{73}}",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Or (the Unbelievers? state) is like the depths of darkness in a vast deep ocean, overwhelmed with billow topped by billow, topped by (dark) clouds:{{3013}} depths of darkness, one{{3014}} above another: if a man stretches out his hands, he can hardly see it! for any to whom Allah giveth not light, there is no light!{{3015}}",
  "en_ctr_asad": "Or [else, their deeds{{60}} are] like the depths of darkness upon an abysmal sea, made yet more dark by wave billowing over wave, with [black] clouds above it all: depths of darkness, layer upon layer,{{61}} [so that when one holds up his hand, he can hardly see it: for he to whom God gives no light, no light whatever has he!",
