  "en_tr_yusuf": "O ye who believe! Be not like the Unbelievers, who say of their brethren, when they are travelling through the Earth or engaged in fighting: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died, or been slain.\" This that Allah may make it a cause of sighs and regrets in their hearts. It is Allah that gives Life and Death, and Allah sees well all that ye do.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "O ye who believe! Be not as those who disbelieved and said of their brethren who went abroad in the land or were fighting in the field: If they had been (here) with us they would not have died or been killed: that Allah may make it anguish in their hearts. Allah giveth life and causeth death; and Allah is Seer of what ye do.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "O you who believe! be not like those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they travel in the earth or engage in fighting: Had they been with us, they would not have died and they would not have been slain; so Allah makes this to be an intense regret in their hearts; and Allah gives life and causes death and Allah sees what you do.",

Be not like those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who say to their brethren when they travel through the earth or go out to fight: \"If they had stayed with us, they would not have died or been killed,\" so that Allah may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allah that gives life and causes death. And Allah is All-Seer of what you do.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "O O Ye who believe! be not like unto those who disbelieve and say of their brethren when they journey in the land or go to religious war: had they been with, they had not died nor had they been slain; this is in order that Allah may cause an anguish in their hearts. And it is Allah who maketh alive and causeth to die, and Allah is of that which ye work Beholder.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Believers, do not be as those who disbelieve and say of their brothers when they journey in the land or go of to battle: 'Had they stayed with us, they would not have died, nor would they have been killed. ' In order that Allah will make that a regret in their hearts. Allah revives and causes to die. He has knowledge of what you do.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "O Believers, be not like those who disbelieve and say of their brothers, when they journey in the land, or are out in battles, `had they been with us, they would not have died or been killed,' that God may make this an anguish in their hearts; but it is God who gives life and makes to die; and God sees the things you do.",
  "en_tr_sher": "O ye who believe! be not like those who have disbelieved, and who say of their brethren when they travel in the land or go forth to war: 'Had they been with us, they would not have died or been slain.' They say this that God may make it a cause of regret in their hearts. And God gives life and causes death and God is Mindful of what you do.",
  "en_tr_asad": "O you who have attained to faith! Be not like those who are bent on denying the truth and say of their brethren [who die] after having set out on a journey to faraway places or gone forth to war, \"Had they but remained with us, they would not have died,\" or, \"they would not have been slain\" &ndash; for God will cause such thoughts to become a source of bitter regret in their hearts, since it is God who grants life and deals death. And God sees all that you do.",

For God gives life, and He makes to die; and God sees the things you do.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Believers, do not behave like those who disbelieved and say to their brothers (who meet some mishap) in the course of their journey for fighting: 'Had they remained with us, they would not have died nor been slain.' Allah makes such thoughts the cause of deep regrets in their hearts.{{113}} For in truth it is Allah alone who grants life and deals death. Allah sees all that you do.",

      "note": "It is want of faith that makes people afraid (1) of meeting death, (2) of doing their duty when it involves danger, as in travelling in order to earn an honest living, or fighting in a sacred cause. Such fear is part of the punishment for want of faith. If you have faith, there is no fear in meeting death, for it brings you nearer to your goal, nor in meeting danger for a sufficient cause, because you know that the keys of life and death are in Allah's hands. Nothing can happen without Allah's Will. If it is Allah's Will that you should die, your staying at home will not save you. If it is His Will that you should live, the danger you incur in a just cause brings you glory. Supposing it is His Will that you should lose your life in the danger, there are three considerations that would make you eager to meet it: (1) dying in doing your duty is the best means of reaching Allah's Mercy; (2) the man of faith knows that he is not going to an unknown country of which he has no news; he is going nearer to Allah; and (3) he is being \"brought together\" unto Allah: i.e., he will meet all his dear ones in faith: instead of the separation which the souls without faith fear, he looks forward to a surer reunion than is possible in this life (Cf. 2:167)."
