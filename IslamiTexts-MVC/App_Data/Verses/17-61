In the present instance, as in Al-A'raf and Al-Hijr, the accent is on the contempt of Iblis for Adam (which is obviously a metonym for the whole human race): hence, this passage apparently connects with the end of verse 53 above - \"verily, Satan is man's open foe!\" The stress on man's dignity - expressed in God's commandment to the aangels to \"prostrate themselves before Adam\" - links this allegory with verses 70-72."
