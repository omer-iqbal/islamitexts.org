The meaning is the same, for a day is a period of 24 hours. But the point of view is different in each case. There it was from the point of view of the Ummah or Congregation, among whom he worked by day; here the point of view is that of his individual soul, which spent the nights in prayer and praise. Notice again that at the end of the next verse, we have here, \"In the morning and in the evening\", and at the end of 3:41, \"In the evening and in the morning\"- showing again that the point of view is reversed."
