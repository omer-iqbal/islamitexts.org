In such cases memory itself is pain. Even sorrow is intensified by memory: as Tennyson says, \"A sorrow's crown of sorrows is remembering happier things.\" But that is in this our imperfect life. In the perfect felicity of the righteous, all such feelings will be blotted out. No \"heartaches\" then and no memories of them! The clouds of the past will have dissolved in glorious light, and no past happiness will be comparable with the perfect happiness which will have then been attained. Nor will any sense of envy or shortcoming be possible in that perfect bliss."
