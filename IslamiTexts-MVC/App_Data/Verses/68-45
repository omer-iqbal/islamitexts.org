(See in this connection note 11 on 10:5 - \"None of this has God created without [an inner] truth\".) Indirectly, the above passage alludes to the question as to the reason why God allows so many evil persons to enjoy their lives to the full, while so many of the righteous are allowed to suffer: the answer being that during his life in this world man cannot really understand where apparent happiness and unhappiness ultimately lead to, and what role they play in God's \"subtle scheme\" of creation."
