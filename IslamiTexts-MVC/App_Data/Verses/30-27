      "note": "Primarily, the term mathal denotes a \"likeness\" or \"similitude\", and hence is often used in the Qur'an (e.g., in the next verse) in the sense of \"parable\". Occasionally, however, it is synonymous with sifah, which signifies the intrinsic \"attribute\", \"quality\" or \"nature\" of a thing, concept or living being (cf. the reference to \"the nature of Jesus\" and \"the nature of Adam\" in 3:59). With reference to God, who is \"sublimely exalted above anything that men may devise by way of definition\" (see 6:100 and the corresponding note 88), the expression mathal clearly points to a quality of being entirely different from all other categories of existence, inasmuch as there is \"nothing like unto Him\" (42:11) and \"nothing that could be compared With Him\" (112:4): hence, the rendering of mathal as 'essence\" is most appropriate in this context."
