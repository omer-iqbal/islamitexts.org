And with Allah is the fairest of rewards.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "So their Lord accepted their prayer: That I will not waste the work of a worker among you, whether male or female, the one of you being from the other; they, therefore, who fled and were turned out of their homes and persecuted in My way and who fought and were slain, I will most certainly cover their evil deeds, and I will most certainly make them enter gardens beneath which rivers flow; a reward from Allah, and with Allah is yet better reward.",

  "en_tr_dbadi": "Then their Lord hearkened unto them saying: I let not the work of a worker amongst you to waste, man or woman, one of you from the other.

And Allah! with Him is the excellent reward.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "And indeed their Lord answers them: 'I do not waste the labor of any that labors among you, male or female you are from each other.

  "en_tr_sher": "So their Lord answered their prayers, saying, 'I will suffer not the work of any worker from among you, whether male or female, to be lost. You are from one another. Those, therefore, who have emigrated, and have been driven out of their homes, and have been persecuted for My cause, and have fought and been slain, I will surely remit from them their evil deeds and will cause them to enter gardens through which streams flow -- a reward from God, and with God is the best of rewards.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And thus does their Sustainer answer their prayer: \n\"I shall not lose sight of the labour of any of you who labours [in My way], be it man or woman: each of you is an issue of the other.
