Some of the commentators incline to the view that this expression comprises all non-Muslims: but this view obviously conflicts with 60:8-9, where the believers are expressly allowed to form friendships with such of the non-believers as are not hostile to them and to their faith. Moreover, the sequence makes it clear that by \"those who are not of your kind\" are meant only people whose enmity to Islam and its followers has become apparent from their behaviour and their utterances (Tabari). The rendering adopted by me, \"people who are not of your kind\", implies that their outlook on life is so fundamentally opposed to that of the Muslims that genuine friendship is entirely out of the question."
