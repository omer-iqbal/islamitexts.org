Even in the original Arabic the meaning seems to be greater than can be expressed in words. The attributes of Allah are different from anything we know in our present world: He lives, but His life is self-subsisting and eternal: it does not depend upon other beings and is not limited to time and space. Perhaps the attribute of Qayyum includes not only the idea of \"Self-subsisting\" but also the idea of \"Keeping up and maintaining all life.\" His life being the source and constant support of all derived forms of life. Perfect life is perfect activity, in contrast to the imperfect life which we see around us, which is not only subject to death but to the need for rest or slowed-down activity, (something which is between activity and sleep, for which I, in common with other translators, have used the word \"slumber\") and the need for full sleep itself. But Allah has no need for rest or sleep. His activity, like His life, is perfect and self-subsisting. Contrast with this the expression used in Psalms 78:65: \"Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.\" (Cf. 20:109-110). (R)."

What is behind that shadow is He. Such reality as our heavens and our earth possess is a reflection of His absolute Reality. The pantheist places the wrong accent when he says that everything is He. The truth is better expressed when we say that everything is His. How then can any creatures stand before Him as of right, and claim to intercede for a fellow-creature? In the first place both are His, and He cares as much for one as for the other. In the second place, they are both dependent on His will and command. But He in His Wisdom and Plan may grade His creatures and give one superiority over another. Then by His will and permission such a one may intercede or help according to the laws and duties laid on him. Allah's knowledge is absolute, and is not conditioned by Time or Space. To us, His creatures, these conditions always apply. His knowledge and our knowledge are therefore in different categories, and our knowledge only gets some reflection of Reality when it accords with His Will and Plan. (Cf. 20:110)."

Thus, for instance, Mujahid and 'Ata' assume that \"that which is between their hands\" means \"that which has happened to them in this world\", while \"that which is behind them\" is an allusion to \"that which will happen to them in the next world\"; Ad-Dahhak and Al-Kalbi, on the other hand, assume the exact opposite and say that \"that which is between their hands\" refers to the next world, \"because they are going towards it\", while \"that which is behind them\" means this world, \"because they are leaving it behind\" (Razi). Another explanation is \"that which took place before them and that which will take place after them\" (Zamakhshari). It would seem, however, that in all these interpretations the obvious meaning of the idiomatic expression ma bayna yadayhi (\"that which lies open between one's hands\") is lost sight of: namely, that which is evident or known, or perceivable; similarly, ma khalfahu means that which is beyond one's ken or perception. Since the whole tenor of the above Qur'an-verse relates to God's omnipotence and omniscience, the translation given by me seems to be the most appropriate."
