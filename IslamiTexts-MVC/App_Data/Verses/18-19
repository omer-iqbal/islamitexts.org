  "en_tr_yusuf": "Such (being their state), we raised them up (from sleep), that they might question each other. Said one of them, \"How long have ye stayed (here)?\" They said, \"We have stayed (perhaps) a day, or part of a day.\" (At length) they (all) said, \"Allah (alone) knows best how long ye have stayed here.... Now send ye then one of you with this money of yours to the town: let him find out which is the best food (to be had) and bring some to you, that (ye may) satisfy your hunger therewith: And let him behave with care and courtesy, and let him not inform any one about you.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And in like manner We awakened them that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said: How long have ye tarried? They said: We have tarried a day or some part of a day, (Others) said: Your Lord best knoweth what ye have tarried. Now send one of you with this your silver coin unto the city, and let him see what food is purest there and bring you a supply thereof. Let him be courteous and let no man know of you.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And thus did We rouse them that they might question each other. A speaker among them said: How long have you tarried? They said: We have tarried for a day or a part of a day. (Others) said: Your Lord knows best how long you have tarried. Now send one of you with this silver (coin) of yours to the city, then let him see which of them has purest food, so let him bring you provision from it, and let him behave with gentleness, and by no means make your case known to any one:",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Likewise, We awakened them (from their long deep sleep) that they might question one another. A speaker from among them said: \"How long have you stayed (here)?\" They said: \"We have stayed (perhaps) a day or part of a day.\" They said: \"Your Lord (Alone) knows best how long you have stayed (here). So send one of you with this silver coin of yours to the town, and let him find out which is the good lawful food, and bring some of that to you. And let him be careful and let no man know of you.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And likewise we raised them up that they might question among themselves; there spake a speaker from amongst them: how long have ye tarried? They said we have tarried a day or part of a day. They said, your Lord knoweth best how long ye have tarried; now send one of you with this your money unto the city and let him see which food is purest there, and let him bring you a provision thereof, and let him be circumspect, and let him by no means discover you to anycne.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "As such We revived them so that they might question one another. 'How long have you stayed here? ' asked one of them. 'We have been here a day, or part of it, ' they replied. They said: 'Your Lord knows best how long we have stayed here. Let one of you go to the city with this silver (coin) and let him search for one who has the purest food and bring provision from it. Let him be courteous, but let no one sense it is you.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And like that We raised them up, that they might question one another. One of them said, `how long have you stayed?' They said, `we have stayed a day or part of a day'. They said, `only your Lord knows best how long you have stayed; send one of you with this coin of yours to the city, and let him look for which of them has purest food, and bring you some provision thereof; and let him be courteous and let him not make any to perceive of you.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And so We raised them up that they might question one another. One of them said, 'How long have you tarried?' They said, 'We have tarried a day or part of a day.' Others said, 'Your Lord knows best the time you have tarried. Now send one of you with these silver coins of yours to the city; and let him see which of the inhabitants has the purest food, and let him bring you provisions thereof. And let him be courteous but let him not inform anyone about you;",
  "en_tr_asad": "And so, [in the course of time,] We awakened them; and they began to ask one another [as to what had happened to them].\nOne of them asked: \"How long have you remained thus?\"\n[The others] answered: \"We have remained thus a day, or part of a day.\"\nSaid they [who were endowed with deeper insight]: \"Your Sustainer knows best how long you have thus remained. Let, then, one of you go with these silver coins to the town, and let him find out what food is purest there, and bring you thereof [some] provisions. But let him behave with great care and by no means make anyone aware of you:",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And even so We raised them up again that they might question one another. One of them said, How long have you tarried? They said, We have tarried a day, or part of a day. They said, Your Lord knows very well how long you have tarried. Now send one of you forth with this silver to the city, and let him look for which of them has purest food, and bring you provision thereof; let him be courteous, and apprise no man of you.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Likewise, We roused them{{16}} in a miraculous way that they might question one another. One of them asked: \"How long did you remain (in this state)?\" The others said: \"We remained so for a day or part of a day.\" Then they said: \"Your Lord knows better how long we remained in this state. Now send one of you to the city with this coin of yours and let him see who has the best food, and let him buy some provisions from there. Let him be cautious and not inform anyone of our whereabouts.",
