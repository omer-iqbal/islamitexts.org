  "en_tr_yusuf": "That is most suitable: that they may give the evidence in its true nature and shape, or else they would fear that other oaths would be taken after their oaths. But fear Allah, and listen (to His counsel): for Allah guideth not a rebellious people:",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Thus it is more likely that they will bear true witness or fear that after their oaths the oaths (of others) will be taken. So be mindful of your duty (to Allah) and hearken. Allah guideth not the froward folk.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "This is more proper in order that they should give testimony truly or fear that other oaths be given after their oaths; and be careful of (your duty to) Allah, and hear; and Allah does not guide the transgressing people.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "That should make it closer (to the fact) that their testimony would be in its true nature and shape (and thus accepted), or else they would fear that (other) oaths would be admitted after their oaths. And fear Allah and listen ( with obedience to Him). And Allah guides not the people who are Al-Fasiqun (the rebellious and disobedient).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "That shall make it more likely that they shall produce the testimony according to the fact thereof or they shall fear that other oaths would be admitted after their oaths. And fear Allah and hearken; and Allah guideth not a transgressing people.",

  "en_tr_asad": "Thus it will be more likely that people will offer testimony in accordance with the truth &ndash; or else they will [have cause to] fear that their oaths will be refuted by the oaths of others. \nBe, then, conscious of God, and hearken [unto Him]: for God does not bestow His guidance upon iniquitous folk.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "So it is likelier that they will bear testimony in proper form, or else they will be afraid that after their oaths, oaths may be rebutted. Fear God, and hearken; God guides not the people of the ungodly.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Thus it is more likely that they will either bear the right testimony or else they will at least fear that their oaths may be rebutted by other oaths. Have fear of Allah and pay heed. Allah does not direct the disobedient to the right way.",
