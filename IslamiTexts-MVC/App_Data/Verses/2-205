      "note": "Lit., \"he hastens about the earth [or \"strives on earth\"] to spread corruption therein and to destroy tilth and progeny\". Most of the commentators see in this sentence an indication of a conscious intent on the part of the person thus described; but it is also possible that the particle li in li-yufsida (generally taken to mean \"in order that he might spread corruption\") plays in this context the role of what the grammarians call a lam al-dqibah, \"the [letter] lam used to denote a consequence\" - i.e., regardless of the existence or non-existence of a conscious intent. (By rendering the sentence the way I do it, both possibilities are left open.) As regards the expression harth (rendered by me as \"tilth\"), its primary significance is \"gain\" or \"acquisition\" through labour; and thus it often signifies \"worldly goods\" (see Lane II, 542), and especially the crops obtained by tilling land, as well as the tilled land itself. If harth is understood in this context as \"tilth\", it would apply, metaphorically, to human endeavours in general, and to social endeavours in particular. However, some commentators - basing their opinion on the Qur'anic sentence, \"your wives are your tilth\" (2:223) - maintain that harth stands here for \"wives\" (cf. Razi, and the philologist Al-Azhari, as quoted in Manar II, 248): in which case the \"destruction of tilth and progeny\" would be synonymous with an upsetting of family life and, consequently, of the entire social fabric. According to either of these two interpretations, the passage has the following meaning: As soon as the mental attitude described above is generally accepted and made the basis of social behaviour, it unavoidably results in widespread moral decay and, consequently, social disintegration."
