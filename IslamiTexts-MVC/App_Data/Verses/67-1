Power (in the clause following) is the Capacity to carry out His Will, so that nothing can resist or neutralise it. Here is beneficence completely identified with Lordship and Power; and it is exemplified in the verses following. Note that Mulk here has a different shade of meaning from Malakut in 36:83. Both words are from the same root, and I have translated both by the word \"Dominion\". But Malakut refers to Lordship in the invisible World, while Mulk to Lordship in the visible World. Allah is Lord of both."
