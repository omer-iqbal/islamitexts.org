The words are fairly comprehensive, and should, I think, be understood in connection with Judgement There the Witnesses may be: (1) the Prophets (3:81); Allah Himself (3:81. and 10:61); (he Recording Angels (50:21); the Sinner's own misused limbs (24:24); his record of deeds (17:14); or the Sinner himself (17:14). The subject of the witness may be the deed or crime, or the Sinner against whom the testimony cries out The appeal to these tilings means that the Sinner cannot possibly escape the consequences of his crime. He should repent, seek Allah's Mercy, and amend his life."
