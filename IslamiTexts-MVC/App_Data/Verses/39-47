  "en_tr_yusuf": "Even if the wrong-doers had all that there is on earth, and as much more, (in vain) would they offer it for ransom from the pain of the Penalty on the Day of Judgment: but something will confront them from Allah, which they could never have counted upon!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And though those who do wrong possess all that is in the earth, and therewith as much again, they verily will seek to ransom themselves therewith on the Day of Resurrection from the awful doom; and there will appear unto them, from their Lord, that wherewith they never reckoned.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And had those who are unjust all that is in the earth and the like of it with it, they would certainly offer it as ransom (to be saved) from the evil of the punishment on the day of resurrection; and what they never thought of shall become plain to them from Allah.",

  "en_tr_ayubk": "And if the wrong-doers had all that is in the earth, and the like of it with it, they would offer it to ransom themselves from the evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection; but there would appear to them from God what they never thought of.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And even if the wrongdoers possessed all that is in the earth, and the like thereof in addition to it, they would, surely, seek to ransom themselves with it to escape from the evil punishment on the Day of Resurrection, but there shall appear unto them from God that which they had never thought of.",
  "en_tr_asad": "But if those who are bent on evildoing possessed all that is on earth, and twice as much, they would surely offer it as ransom from the awful suffering [that will befall them] on the Day of Resurrection: for something with which they had not reckoned before will [by then] have been made obvious to them by God;",
  "en_tr_arberry": "If the evildoers possessed all that is in the earth, and the like of it with it, they would offer it to ransom themselves from the evil of the chastisement on the Day of Resurrection; yet there would appear to them from God that they never reckoned with,",
  "en_tr_maududi": "If the wrong-doers possessed the treasures of the earth in their entirety and as much besides, they would gladly offer it on the Day of Resurrection to redeem themselves from the harrowing chastisement.
