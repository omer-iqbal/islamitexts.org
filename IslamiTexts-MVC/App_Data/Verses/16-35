  "ar_text_clean": "وقال الذين أشركوا لو شاء الله ما عبدنا من دونه من شيء نحن ولا آباؤنا ولا حرمنا من دونه من شيء كذلك فعل الذين من قبلهم فهل على الرسل إلا البلاغ المبين",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "The worshippers of false gods say: \"If Allah had so willed, we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we nor our fathers,- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions other than His.\" So did those who went before them. But what is the mission of messengers but to preach the Clear Message?",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And the idolaters say: Had Allah willed, we had not worshipped aught beside Him, we and our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught without (command from) Him. Even so did those before them. Are the messengers charged with aught save plain conveyance (of the message)?",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And they who give associates (to Allah) say: If Allah had pleased, we would not have served anything besides Allah, (neither) we nor our fathers, nor would we have prohibited anything without (order from) Him. Thus did those before them; is then aught incumbent upon the messengers except a plain delivery (of the message)?",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And those who join others in worship with Allah say: \"If Allah had so willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped aught but Him, nor would we have forbidden anything without (Command from) Him.\" So did those before them. Then! Are the Messengers charged with anything but to convey clearly the Message?",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And those who associate say: had God willed we would not have worshipped aught beside Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor we would have forbidden aught without Him. Like-wise did those before them. Naught is then on the apostles except a preaching plain.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "The idolaters say: 'Had Allah willed, neither we nor our fathers would have worshipped anything other than Him, nor would we have forbidden anything without Him', as such did those before them. Yet what should Messengers do but give a clear deliverance?",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And Those who make associates (to God) say, `had God willed, we would not have served anything apart from Him, neither we nor our fathers, and we would not have made anything, apart from Him, sacred. So did those that were before them. But is there any obligation on the Messengers except to deliver the manifest Message.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And the idolaters say, 'If God had so willed, we should not have worshiped anything beside Him, neither we nor our fathers, nor should we have forbidden anything without command from Him.' So did those who opposed the truth before them. Are the Messengers responsible for anything except the plain delivery of the Message?",
  "en_tr_asad": "Now they who ascribe divinity to aught beside God say, \"Had God so willed, we would not have worshipped aught but Him &ndash; neither we nor our forefathers; nor would we have declared aught as forbidden without a commandment from Him.\"\nEven thus did speak those [sinners] who lived before their time; but, then, are the apostles bound to do more than clearly deliver the message [entrusted to them]?",
  "en_tr_arberry": "The idolators say, If God had willed we would not have served; apart from Him, anything, neither we nor our fathers, nor would we have forbidden, apart from Him, anything. So did those before them; yet is aught for the Messengers, but to deliver the manifest Message?",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity say: \"Were Allah to will so, neither we nor our forefathers would have worshipped any other than Him, nor would we have prohibited anything without His command.\"{{30}} Their predecessors proffered similar excuses.{{31}} Do the Messengers have any other duty but to plainly convey the Message?",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "The worshippers of false gods say: \"If Allah had so willed, we should not have worshipped aught but Him - neither we{{2057}} nor our fathers,- nor should we have prescribed prohibitions{{2058}} other than His.\" So did those who went before them.
