  "en_tr_pickth": "That is because Allah maketh the night to pass into the day and maketh the day to pass into the night, and because Allah is Hearer, Seer.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "That is because Allah causes the night to enter into the day and causes the day to enter into the night, and because Allah is Hearing, Seeing.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "That is because Allah merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night. And verily, Allah is All-Hearer, All-Seer.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "That is to be because Allah plungeth the night into the day and plungeth the day into the night, and because He is Hearing, Beholding.",

      "note": "To some it may appear strange or even irreconcilable that Allah should be both Merciful and Just: that He should both protect His devotees and yet ask for their self-sacrifice; that he should command them to return good for evil, and yet permit retaliation under certain restrictions. But such thoughts are shortsighted. Do they not see many inconsistencies in all Life, all Nature, and all Creation? Why, even in such simple phenomena as Night and Day, the one merges into the other, and no one can tell when precisely the one begins and the other ends. Yet we can see in a rough sort of way that the one gives rest and the other activity, that the one reveals the beauties of the starry heavens and the other the splendour of the sun. In countless ways we can see there the wisdom and the fine artistry of Allah. And there are subtle nuances and mergings in nature that our intelligence can hardly penetrate. Now human life and human relations are far more complicated, and it is Allah alone Who can see all the subtle distinctions and hear the cries of all His creatures, in a world which Tennyson described as \"red in tooth and claw\" (Cf. 35:13).'"
