We award unto those who turn away from Our revelations an evil doom because of their aversion.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Or lest you should say: If the Book had been revealed to us, we would certainly have been better guided than they, so indeed there has come to you clear proof from your Lord, and guidance and mercy.

  "en_tr_dbadi": "Or lest ye should say. if only the Book had been sent down to us, we should surely have been better guided than they.

  "en_tr_qarib": "Or (you say), 'Had the Book been sent down to us, we would have been better guided than they. ' Indeed a clear sign has now come to you from your Lord; a guidance and a mercy.

Who, then, could be more wicked than he who gives the lie to God's messages, and turns away from them in disdain?\nWe shall requite those who turn away from Our messages in disdain with evil suffering for having thus turned away!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "or lest you say, If the Book had been sent down upon us, we had surely been more rightly guided than they.
