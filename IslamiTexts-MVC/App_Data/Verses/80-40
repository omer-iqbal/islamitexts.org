But the dust also suggests that being Rejecters of Allah, their faces and eyes and faculties were choked in dust, and the blackness suggests that being Doers of Iniquity they had no part or lot in purity or Light. Another contrast may possibly be deduced: the humble and lowly may be \"in the dust\" in this life, and the arrogant sinners in sunshine, but the roles will be reversed at Judgement."
