In any case, even and odd follow each other in regular succession: each is independent, and yet neither is self-sufficient. In ultimate analysis every even number is a pair of odd ones. And all things go in pairs: see 36:36, and n. 3981. In the animal world pairs are but two individuals, and yet each is a complement of the other. Both abstract and concrete things are often understood in contrast with their opposites. Why should we not, in spiritual matters, understand this life better with reference to the Hereafter, and why should we disbelieve in the Hereafter simply because we cannot conceive of anything different from our present life?"

The concept of the \"even number\" implies the existence of more than one of the same kind: in other words, it signifies every thing that has a counterpart or counterparts and, hence, a definite relationship with other things (cf. the term azwaj in 36:36, referring to the polarity evident in all creation), As against this, the term al-watr - or, in the more common (Najdi) spelling, al-witr - primarily denotes \"that which is single\" or \"one\" and is, hence, one of the designations given to God - since \"there is nothing that could be compared with Him\" (112:4) and \"nothing like unto Him\" (42:11)."
