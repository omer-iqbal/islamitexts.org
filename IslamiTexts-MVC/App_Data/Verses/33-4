  "en_tr_yusuf": "Allah has not made for any man two hearts in his (one) body: nor has He made your wives whom ye divorce by Zihar your mothers: nor has He made your adopted sons your sons. Such is (only) your (manner of) speech by your mouths. But Allah tells (you) the Truth, and He shows the (right) Way.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Allah hath not assigned unto any man two hearts within his body, nor hath He made your wives whom ye declare (to be your mothers) your mothers, nor hath He made those whom ye claim (to be your sons) your sons. This is but a saying of your mouths. But Allah saith the truth and He showeth the way.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Allah has not made for any man two hearts within him; nor has He made your wives whose backs you liken to the backs of your mothers as your mothers, nor has He made those whom you assert to be your sons your real sons; these are the words of your mouths; and Allah speaks the truth and He guides to the way.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Allah has not put for any man two hearts inside his body. Neither has He made your wives whom you declare to be like your mothers' backs, your real mothers. [Az-Zihar is the saying of a husband to his wife, \"You are to me like the back of my mother\" i.e. You are unlawful for me to approach.], nor has He made your adopted sons your real sons. That is but your saying with your mouths. But Allah says the truth, and He guides to the (Right) Way.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Allah hath not placed unto any man two hearts in his inside, nor hath He made your spouses whom ye declare to be as your mother's backs, your real mothers, nor hath He made your adopted sons your real sons. This is only your saying by your mouths, whereas Allah saith the truth and He guideth the way.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Allah has never made any man with two hearts inside him. Nor has He made your wives, when you divorce, saying: 'Be as my mother's back, ' your mothers. Neither has He made your fostered sons as your own sons. These are your own sayings, words which you utter with your mouths; but Allah speaks the truth and guides to the Path.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "God has not made for any man two hearts in his body; and He has not made your wives, whom you declare to be your mothers, your mothers; and He has not made your adopted sons your sons; that is your saying, words of your mouths; but God speaks the truth, and He guides to the Way.",
  "en_tr_sher": "God has not made for any man two hearts in his breast; nor has He made those of your wives from whom you keep away by calling them mothers, your mothers in fact, nor has He made those whom you adopt as sons, your sons in fact. These are merely the words of your mouths; but God declares the truth, and He guides to the right path.",
  "en_tr_asad": "NEVER has God endowed any man with two hearts in one body: and [just as] He has never made your wives whom you may have declared to be \"as unlawful to you as your mothers' bodies\" [truly] your mothers, so, too, has He never made your adopted sons [truly] your sons: these are but [figures of] speech uttered by your mouths &ndash; whereas God speaks the [absolute] truth: and it is He alone who can show [you] the right path.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "God has not assigned to any man two hearts within his breast; nor has He made your wives, when you divorce, saying, Be as my mothers back, truly your mothers, neither has He made your adopted sons your sons in fact. That is your own saying, the words of your mouths; but God speaks the truth, and guides on the way.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Allah has never put two hearts within one person's body;{{5}} nor has He made your wives, whom you compare to your mothers' backs (to divorce them),{{6}} your true mothers; nor has He made those whom you adopt as sons your own sons.{{7}} These are only words that you utter with your mouths. But Allah proclaims the Truth and directs you to the Right Path.",
