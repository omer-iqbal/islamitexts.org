But in general meaning it applies to all. We are taught that evil will be visited with a terrible punishment, not only in a future life, but in this life when its cup is full and the time comes for punishment in Allah's Plan. If it has to come while we are still on the scene of this life, we are asked to pray that we may not be found in the company of those who draw such punishment on themselves. In other words we must eschew the society of evil ones."
