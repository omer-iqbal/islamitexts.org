The wrong is indicated: 'driven by persecution from their home, for no other reason than that they worshipped the One True God 1 .

All relevant Traditions (quoted, particular, by Tabari and Ibn Kathir) show that this is the earliest Qur'anic reference to th' problem of war as such. According to Abd Allih ibn Abbas, it was revealed immediately after thE Prophet left Mecca for Medina, i.e., at the beginning of the year 1 H. The principle of war ii self-defence - and only in self-defence - has been further elaborated in Al-Baqarah, which was revealed about a year later (see 2:190-193 and the corresponding notes)."
