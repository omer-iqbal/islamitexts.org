The fact of its coming is certain: the exact time when it will come has not been revealed. If it were, it would disturb our thoughts and life. \"Heavy were its burden through the heavens and the earth.\" But at any given moment it cannot be far distant. In theological language, each individual's death is a Final Hour, a Qiyamah Sughra (Lesser Day of Judgement). In that sense it is not the same for all individuals, and is certainly always near, \"In the midst of life we are in death\", as the Anglican Prayer-Book says in its Burial Service."
