In C. 1, I have construed the same word by the word \"Agent.\" Another idea implied in \"Khalifah\" is that of \"successor, heir, or inheritor,\" i.e., one who has the ultimate ownership after the present possessors, to whom a life tenancy has been given by the owner, have passed away. In 15:23 occurs the striking word, \"heirs\" (warithun), applied to Allah: \"We give life and death, and We are the Heirs (or Inheritors).\" The same idea occurs in 3:180, where see n, 485, and 19:40. The translation here attempts to express both the ideas which I understand from the original."
