Since, however, the Qur'anic statement that \"you shall be raised again after death\" is not - as has been pointed out by Razi - an \"act\" in the proper connotation of this word, it would be illogical to assume that this statement could be characterized as \"sorcery\" even by those who do not believe in it. On the other hand, it is obvious that they dismiss it contemptuously as a mere \"enchanting delusion\" intended to prevent those who are able to do so from enjoying their worldly life to the full (Razi) or, alternatively, to induce the poor and unfortunate to remain passively satisfied with their miserable lot on earth: and this is the meaning of sihr in the above context.
