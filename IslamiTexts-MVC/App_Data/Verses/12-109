Reflect then ye not!",
  "en_tr_qarib": "We did not send any before you from the inhabitants of the village, but men to whom a revelation was sent.

Have these people not travelled in the earth that they may observe the end of their predecessors? Certainly the abode of the Hereafter is much better for those (who accepted the call of the Messengers and) acted in a God-fearing manner. Will you still not act with good sense?{{79}}",
