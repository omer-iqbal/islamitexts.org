The other prophets mentioned in the Qur'tn who \"preached in the Arabic tongue\" were Ishmael, Hud, Salih and Shu'ayb, all of them Arabians, in addition, if we bear in mind that Hebrew and Aramaic are but ancient Arabic dialects, all the Hebrew prophets may be included among \"those who preached in the Arabic tongue\"."
