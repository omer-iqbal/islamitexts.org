  "en_tr_yusuf": "We know indeed that they say, \"It is a man that teaches him.\" The tongue of him they wickedly point to is notably foreign, while this is Arabic, pure and clear.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And We know well that they say: Only a man teacheth him. The speech of him at whom they falsely hint is outlandish, and this is clear Arabic speech.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And certainly We know that they say: Only a mortal teaches him. The tongue of him whom they reproach is barbarous, and this is clear Arabic tongue.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And indeed We know that they (polytheists and pagans) say: \"It is only a human being who teaches him (Muhammad SAW).\" The tongue of the man they refer to is foreign, while this (the Qur'an) is a clear Arabic tongue.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And assuredly We know that they say: it is only a human being who teachech him. The speech of him unto whom they incline is foreign while this is Arabic speech plain.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "We know very well that they say: 'A mortal teaches him. ' The tongue of him at whom they hint is a nonArab; and this is a clear Arabic tongue.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And We do know that they say, `only a mortal teaches him', his language, to whom they refer, is foreign, while this is clear Arabic language.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And indeed We know that they say that it is only a man who teaches him. But the tongue of him towards whom their minds is inclined in making this insinuation is foreign while this is Arabic tongue plain and clear.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And, indeed, full well do We know that they say, \"It is but a human being that imparts [all] this to him!\" &ndash; [notwithstanding that] the tongue of him to whom they so maliciously point is wholly outlandish, whereas this is Arabic speech, clear [in itself] and clearly showing the truth [of its source].",

  "en_tr_maududi": "Surely We know well that they say about you: \"It is only a human being who teaches him,\"{{107}} (notwithstanding) that he whom they maliciously hint at is of foreign tongue, while this (Qur'an) is plain Arabic speech.",

The Pagans and those who were hostile to the revelation of Allah in Islam could not and cannot understand how such wonderful words could flow from the tongue of the Prophet. They must postulate some human teacher. Unfortunately for their postulate, any possible human teacher they could think of would be poor in Arabic speech if he had all the knowledge that the Qur'an reveals of previous revelations. Apart from that, even the most eloquent Arab could not, and cannot, produce anything of the eloquence, width, and depth of Quranic teaching, as is evident from every verse of the Book (Cf. 41:44).

      "note": "Whereas some of the pagan Quraysh regarded the ideas expressed in the Qur'an as \"invented\" by Muhammad, others thought that they must have been imparted to him by a foreigner - perhaps a Christian - who lived in Mecca at that time, or whom the Prophet was supposed to have encountered at an earlier period of his life. Various conjectures have been advanced - both by early Muslim commentators and by modern orientalists - as to the \"identity\" of the person or persons whom the suspicious Meccans might have had in mind in this connection; but all these conjectures are purely speculative and, therefore, of no historical value whatever. The suspicion of the pagan Meccans implies no more than the historical fact that those of the Prophet's opponents who were unwilling to pay him the compliment of having \"invented\" the Qur'an (the profundity of which they were unable to deny) conveniently attributed its authorship or at least its inspiration - to a mythical non-Arab \"teacher\" of the Prophet."
