According to Arab philologists, the term mann denotes not only the sweet, resinous substance exuded by certain plants of the desert, but also everything that is \"bestowed as a favour\", i.e., without any effort on the part of the recipient. Similarly, the term salwa signifies not merely \"a quail\" or \"quails\", but also \"all that makes man content and happy after privation\" (Qamus). Hence the combination of these two terms denotes, metonymically, the gift of sustenance freely bestowed by God upon the followers of Moses."
