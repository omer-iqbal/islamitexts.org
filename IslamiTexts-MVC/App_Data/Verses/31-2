      "note": "This Surah relates to Wisdom and the Qur'an is appropriately called the Wise Book, or the Book of Wisdom. In verse 12 below there is a reference to Luqman the Wise. \"Wise\" in this sense (Hakim) means not only a man versed in knowledge human and divine, but one carrying out in practical conduct ('amal) the right course in life to the utmost of his power. His knowledge is correct and practical, but not necessarily complete: for no man is perfect. Such an ideal involves the conception of a man of heroic action as well as of deep and workmanlike knowledge of nature and human nature-not merely dreams or speculation. That ideal was fulfilled in a most remarkable degree in the Prophet, and in the sacred Book which was revealed through him. \"The Wise Book\" (alKitab alHalum) is one of the title of the Qur'an."
