      "note": "The plots against Mustafa in Makkah aimed at three things. They were not only foiled, but Allah's underfill working turned the tables, and brought good out of evil in each case. (1) They tried to hold the Prophet in subjection in Makkah by putting pressure on his uncles, relatives, and friends. But the more they persecuted, the more the little Muslim community grew in faith and numbers. (2) They tried to injure or ay him. But the wonderful example of his humility, perseverance, and fearlessness furthered the cause of Islam. (3) They tried to get him and his followers out of their homes. But they found a new home in Madinah, from which they eventually reconquered not only Makkah, but Arabia and the world."
