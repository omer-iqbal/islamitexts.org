The terrible curses denounced in the Old Testament are set out in Deut. 28:15-68. There is one difference. Here it is for the deliberate rejection of Faith, a theological term for the denying of our higher nature. There it is for a breach of the least part of the ceremonial Law. (R)."

God's rejection (la'nah) denotes \"exclusion from His grace\" (Manar II, 50). In classical Arabic usage, the primary meaning of la'nah is equivalent to ib'ad (\"estrangement\" or \"banishment\"); in the terminology of the Qur'an, it signifies \"rejection from all that is good\" (Lisan al-'Arab). According to Ibn Abbas and several outstanding scholars of the next generation, the divine writ mentioned here is the Bible; thus, the above verse refers to the Jews and the Christians."
