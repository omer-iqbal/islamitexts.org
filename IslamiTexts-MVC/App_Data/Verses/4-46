  "ar_text_clean": "من الذين هادوا يحرفون الكلم عن مواضعه ويقولون سمعنا وعصينا واسمع غير مسمع وراعنا ليا بألسنتهم وطعنا في الدين ولو أنهم قالوا سمعنا وأطعنا واسمع وانظرنا لكان خيرا لهم وأقوم ولكن لعنهم الله بكفرهم فلا يؤمنون إلا قليلا",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Of the Jews there are those who displace words from their (right) places, and say: \"We hear and we disobey\"; and \"Hear what is not Heard\"; and \"Ra'ina\"; with a twist of their tongues and a slander to Faith. If only they had said: \"What hear and we obey\"; and \"Do hear\"; and \"Do look at us\"; it would have been better for them, and more proper; but Allah hath cursed them for their Unbelief; and but few of them will believe.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Some of those who are Jews change words from their context and say: \"We hear and disobey; hear thou as one who heareth not\" and \"Listen to us!\" distorting with their tongues and slandering religion. If they had said: \"We hear and we obey: hear thou, and look at us\" it had been better for them, and more upright. But Allah hath cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not, save a few.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Of those who are Jews (there are those who) alter words from their places and say: We have heard and we disobey and: Hear, may you not be made to hear! and: Raina, distorting (the word) with their tongues and taunting about religion; and if they had said (instead): We have heard and we obey, and hearken, and unzurna it would have been better for them and more upright; but Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief, so they do not believe but a little.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Among those who are Jews, there are some who displace words from (their) right places and say: \"We hear your word (O Muhammad SAW ) and disobey,\" and \"Hear and let you (O Muhammad SAW) hear nothing.\" And Ra'ina with a twist of their tongues and as a mockery of the religion (Islam). And if only they had said: \"We hear and obey\", and \"Do make us understand,\" it would have been better for them, and more proper, but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they believe not except a few.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Of those who are Judaised, are they who pervert Words from their meanings and say: We hear and we disobey, and:  hear thou without being made to hear, and RA'INA, twisting their tongues and scoffing at the faith! And had they said: we hear and obey, and: hear thou, and: UNZURNA, it had surely been better for them and more upright. But Allah hath cursed them for their infidelity, wherefore they shall not believe, save a few.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Some Jews tampered with the words (altering) their places saying: 'We have heard and we disobey, ' and 'Hear, without hearing, ' and 'Observe us (Ra'ina, in Hebrew means evil) ', twisting with their tongues traducing religion. But if they had said: 'We have heard and obey, ' and 'Hear, ' and 'Regard us, ' it would have been better for them, and more upright; but Allah has cursed them for their disbelief, so they do not believe, except a few.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Some of the Jews pervert words out of their context and say, `we have heard and we disobey', and `hear, and be thou not given to hear,' and `have regard for us', twisting with their tongues and speaking ill of religion. But if they had said, `we have heard and we obey' and `hear' and `look at us', it would have been better and more upright for them; but God has cursed them for their unbelief, so they do not believe except a few.",
  "en_tr_sher": "There were some among the Jews who pervert words from their proper places. And they say, 'We hear and we disobey' and 'hear us and may God's Word never be heard by you,' and they say, 'Ra'ina.' They say all this twisting with their tongues and seeking to injure the Faith. And if they had said, 'We hear and we obey,' and hear thou,' and 'Unzurna,' it would have been better for them and more upright. But God has cursed them for their disbelief; so they believe but little.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Among those of the Jewish faith there are some who distort the meaning of the [revealed] words, taking them out of their context and saying [as it were,] \"We have heard, but we disobey,\" and \"Hear without hearkening,\" and, \"Hearken thou unto us, [O Muhammad]\" &ndash; thus making a play with their tongues, and implying that the [true] Faith is false. And had they but said, \"We have heard, and we pay heed,\" and \"Hear [us], and have patience with us,\" it would indeed have been for their own good, and more upright: but God has rejected them because of their refusal to acknowledge the truth &ndash; for it is in but few things that they believe.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Some of the Jews pervert words from their meanings saying, We have heard and we disobey and Hear, and be thou not given to hear and Observe us, twisting with their tongues and traducing religion. If they had said, We have heard and obey and Hear and Regard us, it would have been better for them, and more upright; but God has cursed them for their unbelief so they believe not except a few.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Among those who have become Jews{{72}} there are some who alter the words from their context,{{73}} and make a malicious play with their tongues and seek to revile the true faith. They say: 'We have heard and we disobey' (sami'na wa 'asayna),{{74}} 'Do hear us, may you turn dumb' (isma' ghayr musma') {{75}} and 'Hearken to us' (ra'ina). It would indeed have been better for them and more upright if they had said: 'We have heard and we obey' (sami'na wa ata'na) {{76}} and: 'Do listen to us, and look at us (with kindness)' (wa isma' wa unzurna). But Allah has cursed them because of their disbelief. Scarcely do they believe.",
