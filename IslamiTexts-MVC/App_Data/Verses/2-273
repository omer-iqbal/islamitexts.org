  "en_tr_yusuf": "(Charity is) for those in need, who, in Allah's cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land, seeking (For trade or work): the ignorant man thinks, because of their modesty, that they are free from want. Thou shalt know them by their (Unfailing) mark: They beg not importunately from all the sundry. And whatever of good ye give, be assured Allah knoweth it well.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "(Alms are) for the poor who are straitened for the cause of Allah, who cannot travel in the land (for trade). The unthinking man accounteth them wealthy because of their restraint.

  "en_tr_shakir": "(Alms are) for the poor who are confined in the way of Allah-- they cannot go about in the land; the ignorant man thinks them to be rich on account of (their) abstaining (from begging); you can recognise them by their mark; they do not beg from men importunately; and whatever good thing you spend, surely Allah knows it.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "(Charity is) for Fuqara (the poor), who in Allah's Cause are restricted (from travel), and cannot move about in the land (for trade or work).

And whatever you spend in good, surely Allah knows it well.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Alms are for the poor who are restricted in the way of Allah, disabled from going about in the land. The (unknowing taketh them for the affluent because of their modesty thou I wouldst recognise them by their appearance: they ask not of men with importunity. And whatsoever ye shall expend of good, verily Allah is thereof Knower",
  "en_tr_qarib": "(Charity is) for the poor who are restrained in the way of Allah, and are unable to journey in the land. The ignorant take them to be rich because of their abstinence. But you can recognize them by their signs. They do not persistently beg people. Whatever good you give is known to Allah.",

And whatever of wealth you spend, Surely God has perfect knowledge thereof.",
  "en_tr_asad": "[And give] unto [such of] the needy who, being wholly wrapped up in God's cause, are unable to go about the earth [in search of livelihood]. He who is unaware [of their condition] might think that they are wealthy, because they abstain [from begging]; [but] thou canst recognize them by their special mark: they do not beg of men with importunity. And whatever good you may spend [on them], verily, God knows it all.",

And whatever good you expend, surely God has knowledge of it.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Those who are engaged so much in the cause of Allah that they cannot move about in the land to earn their livelihood and are, therefore, in straitened circumstances, specially deserve help. An ignorant person would suppose them to be well off because of their self-respect; you can know their real condition from their faces, for they are not the ones who would beg of people with importunity. And Allah will surely know whatever you will spend on them.{{314}}",
