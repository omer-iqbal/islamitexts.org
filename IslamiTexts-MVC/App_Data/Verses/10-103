It is necessitated by the fact that the adverbial conjunction thumma (\"thereupon\" or \"thereafter\") does not relate here to the immediately preceding passage but to a theme repeatedly occurring in the Qur'an and only indirectly alluded to in verse 102 above: namely, the experiences of the earlier prophets with their recalcitrant communities, the doom of those who gave the lie to their messages and, in every case, a divine deliverance of the prophet concerned and of those who followed him. Rashid Rida' describes this passage, rightly, as \"one of the most outstanding examples of the elliptic mode of expression (ijaz) to be found in the Qur'an\" (Manar XI, 487)."
