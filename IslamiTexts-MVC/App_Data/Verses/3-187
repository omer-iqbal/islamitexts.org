  "en_tr_yusuf": "And remember Allah took a covenant from the People of the Book, to make it known and clear to mankind, and not to hide it; but they threw it away behind their backs, and purchased with it some miserable gain! And vile was the bargain they made!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And (remember) when Allah laid a charge on those who had received the Scripture (He said): Ye are to expound it to mankind and not to hide it. But they flung it behind their backs and bought thereby a little gain. Verily evil is that which they have gained thereby.",

And indeed worst is that which they bought.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And recall what time Allah took a bond from those who were vouchsafed the Book: ye shall surely expound it to the people and ye shall hide it not; whereafter they cast it behind their backs, and bartered it for a small price. Vile is that wherewith they have bartered.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "When Allah took a covenant with those to whom the Book was given, (saying): 'You shall make it clear to the people, and not conceal it. 'But they threw it behind their backs and they bought with it a little price. Evil was what they bought.",

  "en_tr_sher": "And remember when God took a covenant from those who were given the Book, saying, 'You shall expound it to the people and not hide it.' But they threw it away behind their backs, and bartered it for a paltry price. Evil is that which they purchased.",
  "en_tr_asad": "AND LO, God accepted a solemn pledge from those who were granted earlier revelation [when He bade them]: \"Make it known unto mankind, and do not conceal it!\"\nBut they cast this [pledge] behind their backs, and bartered it away for a trifling gain: and how evil was their bargain!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And when God took compact with those who had been given the Book: You shall make it clear unto the people, and not conceal it. But they rejected it behind their backs and sold it for a small price -- how evil was that their selling!",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And recall when Allah took a covenant from those who were given the Book: 'You shall explain it to men and not hide it.{{132}} Then they cast the Book behind their backs, and sold it away for a trivial gain. Evil indeed is their bargain.",
