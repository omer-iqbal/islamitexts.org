  "en_tr_yusuf": "Never stand thou forth therein. There is a mosque whose foundation was laid from the first day on piety; it is more worthy of the standing forth (for prayer) therein. In it are men who love to be purified; and Allah loveth those who make themselves pure.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Never stand (to pray) there. A place of worship which was found upon duty (to Allah) from the first day is more worthy that thou shouldst stand (to pray) therein, wherein are men who love to purify themselves. Allah loveth the purifiers.",

  "en_tr_sher": "Never stand to pray therein. A Mosque founded upon piety from the very first day is surely more worthy that thou shouldst stand to pray therein. In it are men who love to become purified, And God loves those who purify themselves.",

  "en_tr_maududi": "You should never stand in that building: the Mosque which has been founded on piety from the very first day, is the proper place for you to stand (for prayer). For there are such people in it as would like to keep themselves pure; and Allah likes those people who like to keep themselves pure.{{102}}",

There are, however, authentic Traditions to the effect that the Prophet applied the designation of \"a house of worship founded on God-consciousness\" to his (later-built) mosque at Medina as well (Muslim, Tirmidhi, Nasa'i, Ibn Hanbal). It is, therefore, reasonable to assume that it applies to every mosque sincerely dedicated by its founders, to the worship of God: a view which is supported by the next verse."
