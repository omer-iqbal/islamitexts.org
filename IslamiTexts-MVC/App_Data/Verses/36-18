From Ta'ir (bird) came tatayyara, or ittayyara, to draw evil omens. Because the prophets of Allah denounced evil, the evildoers thought that they brought ill-luck to them. As a matter of fact any evil that happened to them was the result of their own ill-deeds. Cf. 17:13, where the Egyptians ascribed their calamities to the ill-luck brought by Moses: and 27:47, where Thamud ascribed ill-luck to the preaching of Salih."
