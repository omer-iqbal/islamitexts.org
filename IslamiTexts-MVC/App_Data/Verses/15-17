In its widest, abstract sense it denotes every \"satanic force\", i.e., every impulsion directed towards ends which are contrary to valid ethical postulates. In the present context, the phrase \"every satanic force accursed (rajim)\" - like the phrase \"every rebellious (marid) satanic force\" in a similar context in 37:7 - apparently refers to endeavours, strongly condemned in Islam, to divine the future by means of astrological speculations: hence the preceding reference to the skies and the stars. The statement that God has made the heavens \"secure\" against such satanic forces obviously implies that He has made it impossible for the latter to obtain, through astrology or what is popularly described as \"occult sciences\", any real knowledge of \"that which is beyond the reach of human perception\" (al-ghayb)."
