And then, Creation is such a complex process; see some of the ideas involved explained by different words in n. 120 to 2:117.

We need not suppose that angelic \"wings\" have muscles and feathers, like the wings of birds. If they had, how could there be three, or any odd number? We may suppose \"two, three, or four\" to refer to pairs of wings. But we must not suppose \"two, three, or four\" to express precise numbers, for in sacred literature we find mention of angels with six hundred wings. And we can imagine angels with just one pair of wings. They are Messengers or Instruments of Allah's Will, and may have a few or numerous Errands entrusted to them. Cf. the description of the Spirit of Inspiration in 26:193, and of the spirits or angels for executing the Commands of Allah in 79:1-5."
