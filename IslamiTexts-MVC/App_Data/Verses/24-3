      "note": "The term mushrik (fern, mushrikah), which normally signifies a person who associates in his or her mind all manner of imaginary deities or forces with God, or who believes that any created being has a share in His qualities or powers, is here evidently used in the widest metaphorical sense of this term, denoting one who accords to his or her desires a supremacy which is due to God alone, and thus blasphemes against the principles of ethics and morality enjoined by Him. The particle aw (lit., \"or\") which connects the word mushrikah with the preceding word zanjyah (\"adulteress\") has in this context - as well as in the next clause, where both these terms appear in their masculine form - an amplifying, explanatory value equivalent to the expression \"in other words\" or \"that is\", similar to the use of this particle in 23:6. For a further elucidation of the above passage, see next note."

On the other hand, since adultery is an illicit sexual union, the verb yankihu, which appears twice in this passage, cannot have the customary, specific meaning of \"he marries\" but must, rather, be understood in its general sense - applicable to both lawful and unlawful sexual intercourse - namely, \"he couples with\". It is in this sense that the great commentator Abu-Muslim (as quoted by Razi) explains the above verse, which stresses the fact that both partners are equally guilty inasmuch as they commit their sin consciously - implying that neither of them can excuse himself or herself on the ground of having been merely \"seduced\"."
