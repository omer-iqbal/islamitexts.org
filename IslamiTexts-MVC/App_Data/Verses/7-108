This was to counter any suggestions of evil, which the serpent might have created. This was no work of evil - of black magic, or a trick or illusion. His hand was transfigured-with a light which no Egyptian sorcerers could produce. In Islam the \"white hand\" of Moses has passed into a proverb, for a symbol of divine glory dazzling to the beholders."
