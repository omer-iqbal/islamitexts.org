      "note": "The term latif denotes something that is extremely subtle in quality, and therefore intangible and unfathomable. Whenever this term occurs in the Qur'an with reference to God in conjunction with the adjective khabir (\"all-aware\"), it is invariably used to express the idea of His inaccessibility to human perception, imagination or comprehension, as contrasted with His Own all-awareness (see, apart from the above verse, also 22:63, 31:16, 33:34 and 67:14). In the two instances where the combination of latif and khabir carries the definite article al (6:103 and 67:14), the expression huwa l'latif has the meaning of \"He alone is unfathomable\" - implying that this quality of His is unique and absolute."
