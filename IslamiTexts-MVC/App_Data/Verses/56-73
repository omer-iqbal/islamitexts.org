In the same way the sower's seed has a symbolical meaning in the preaching of the Message: see 48:29, and n. 4917: and the Rain and the Streams of water have a symbolical meaning: see notes 2404-5 to 18:60."

Even ordinarily, a fire in a desert is a sign of human habitation; by following it you may get human society and human comfort. A fire, or light, or beacon in many places directs a traveller on the way. Lighthouses at sea and beacons in modern aerodromes serve the same purpose for mariners and airmen. Another parable about fire will be found in 2:17-18, and n. 38."

      "note": "The participial noun muqw is derived from the verb qawiya, \"it became deserted\" or \"desolate\". From the same root is derived the noun qawa' (or qiwa), which signifies \"desert\", \"wilderness\" or \"wasteland\" as well as \"hunger\" or \"starvation\". Hence, muqw denotes \"one who is hungry\" as well as \"one who is lost [or \"who wanders\"] in a deserted place\". In the above verse this expression is evidently used tropically, for it is difficult to imagine that, as some commentators assume, it relates merely to \"wayfarers in the desert\". My composite rendering of al-muqwin as \"all who are lost and hungry in the wilderness\", on the other hand, is literal and tropical at the same time, inasmuch as it describes people who are lonely, unfortunate and confused, and who hunger after human warmth and spiritual light."
