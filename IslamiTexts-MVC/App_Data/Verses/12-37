  "en_tr_yusuf": "He said: \"Before any food comes (in due course) to feed either of you, I will surely reveal to you the truth and meaning of this ere it befall you: that is part of the (duty) which my Lord hath taught me. I have (I assure you) abandoned the ways of a people that believe not in Allah and that (even) deny the Hereafter.",

  "en_tr_qarib": "He said: 'Before any food comes to feed either of you, I will give you its interpretation. That which I will tell you has been taught to me by Allah. I reject the belief of a nation who do not believe in Allah and disbelieve in the Everlasting Life.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "He said, `the food that you are provided shall not come to you, but I shall tell you its interpretation before it comes to you; that is of the knowledge that God has given me; I have forsaken the creed of a people who do not believe in God and who disbelieve in the Hereafter.",
  "en_tr_sher": "He replied, 'The food which you are given shall not come to you but I shall inform you of the interpretation thereof before it comes to you.
