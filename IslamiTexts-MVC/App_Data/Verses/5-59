Our test will be: what treatment Allah meted out to the things 1 mention. Who were the people who incurred the curse of Allah? (See Deut. 11:28, and 28:15-68; and numerous passages like Hosea 8:14, and 9:1.). Who provoked Allah's wrath? (See numerous passages like Deut. 1:34; Matt. 3:7.) Who forsook Allah, and worshipped evil? (See Jeremiah, 16:11-13). That is your record. Is that why you hate us?'"
