In 99:5, it is applied to the earth: We shall discuss the precise meaning when we come to that passage. The honeycomb, itself, with its hexagonal cells, geometrically perfect, is a wonderful structure, and is well called buyut, homes. And the way the bee finds out inaccessible places, in the hills, in the trees, and even among the habitations of men, is one of the marvels of nature, i.e., of Allah's working in His Creation."

Together with the subsequently mentioned transmutation, in the bee's body, of plant juices into honey, this provides a striking evidence of \"God's ways\" manifested in all nature."
