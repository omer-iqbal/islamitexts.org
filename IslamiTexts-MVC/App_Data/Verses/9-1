The general sense is explained in the introduction to this Surah. In verse 3 below I use the periphrasis \"dissolve treaty obligations,\" which goes some way to explain the meaning. The Pagans and enemies of Islam frequently made treaties of mutual alliances with the Muslims. The Muslims scrupulously observed their part, but the Pagans violated their part again and again when it suited them. After some years' experience it became imperative to denounce such treaties altogether. This was done in due form, with four months' notice, and a chance was given to those who faithfully observed their pledges, to continue their alliance. (R.)."

The above passage connects with verses 56-58 of the preceding surah (Al-Anfal). The noun bara'ah (derived from the verb bari'a, \"he became free [of something]\" or \"quit of having any part [in something]\") signifies a declaration of being free or quit of any bond, moral or contractual, with the person or persons concerned (see Lane I, 178); with reference to God - or the Apostle speaking in God's name - it is best rendered as \"disavowal\"."
