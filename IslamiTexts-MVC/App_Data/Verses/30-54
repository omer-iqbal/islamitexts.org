On the contrary, we are asked to contemplate the mysteries of Allah's wisdom with another Parable. In our physical life we see how strength is evolved out of weakness and weakness out of strength. The helpless babe becomes a lusty man in the pride of manhood, and then sinks to a feeble old age: and yet there is wisdom in all these stages in the Universal Plan. So Allah carries out His Plan in the spiritual world \"as He wills\", i.e., according to His Will and Plan, and none can gainsay it. And His Plan is wise and can never be frustrated."
