To march with the troops along valleys, or, spiritually, tread paths of danger along with our Comrades, is good and praiseworthy; but one that dashes across a stream, all alone, for some special deed of bravery where the elan of comradeship does not sustain him, needs special mention. Notice that both the things mentioned in this verse?the spending of resources and the dashing across a valley?are individual acts, while those mentioned in the last verse are collective acts, which are in some ways easier. The individual acts having been mentioned, the next verse follows naturally."

As Zamakhshari rightly points out in his commentary on this verse, the term wadi (\"valley\" or \"river-bed\") is often used in classical Arabic to denote \"the earth\" - a usage which even in our days is familiar to the bedouin of the Arabian Peninsula, especially when combined with the verb qata'a (lit., \"he cut\") in its connotation of \"cutting across\" or \"traversing [a distance]\" or \"advancing [on a journey]\". Thus, the above Qur'anic phrase may be suitably rendered as \"whenever they move on earth\". (As regards the construction of this sentence, see preceding note.)"
