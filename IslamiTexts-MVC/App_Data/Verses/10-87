      "note": "This instruction, we may suppose, was given when the sorcerers were brought to confusion, and some of the Egyptians believed. Moses was for a little while to remain in Egypt, so that his Message should have time to work, before the Israelites were led out of Egypt. They were to make their houses into places of prayer (Qiblah), as Pharaoh would not probably allow them to set up public places of prayer, and they were now to be only sojourners in Egypt. The Qiblah was to be symbolical of their later wanderings in Arabia, and the still later restoration of Allah's pure worship at the Ka'bah under al Mustafa. These were the glad tidings (the Gospel) of Islam, which was preached under Noah, Abraham, Moses, and Jesus, and completed under Muhammad."
