  "en_tr_yusuf": "Allah disdains not to use the similitude of things, lowest as well as highest. Those who believe know that it is truth from their Lord; but those who reject Faith say: \"What means Allah by this similitude?\" By it He causes many to stray, and many He leads into the right path; but He causes not to stray, except those who forsake (the path),-",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Lo! Allah disdaineth not to coin the similitude even of a gnat. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord; but those who disbelieve say: What doth Allah wish (to teach) by such a similitude? He misleadeth many thereby, and He guideth many thereby; and He misleadeth thereby only miscreants;",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Surely Allah is not ashamed to set forth any parable-- (that of) a gnat or any thing above that; then as for those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord, and as for those who disbelieve, they say: What is it that Allah means by this parable: He causes many to err by it and many He leads aright by it! but He does not cause to err by it (any) except the transgressors,",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Verily, Allah is not ashamed to set forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much more when it is bigger (or less when it is smaller) than it. And as for those who believe, they know that it is the Truth from their Lord, but as for those who disbelieve, they say: \"What did Allah intend by this parable?\" By it He misleads many, and many He guides thereby. And He misleads thereby only those who are Al-Fasiqun (the rebellious, disobedient to Allah).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Verily Allah is not ashamed to propound a similitude, be it of a gnat or of aught above it. Then as to those who believe, they know that it is the truth from their Lord. And to those who disbelieve, they say what intendeth God by similitude? He sendeth many astray thereby, and He guideth many thereby, and He sendeth not astray thereby any except the transgressors,",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Allah is not shy to strike a parable whatsoever a gnat or larger. Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord. As for those who disbelieve they ask: 'What could Allah mean by this parable? By it, Allah misleads many and guides many. ' But He misleads none except the evildoers,",

Then, as for the Believers, they know that it is the truth from their Lord; but as for the unbelievers, they say, `what does God desire by this similitude?' Thereby He sends astray many and thereby He guides many; but thereby He sends none astray except the transgressors, ",

Those who believe know that it is the truth from their Lord, while those who disbelieve say, 'What does God mean by such an illustration?'

Now, as for those who have attained to faith, they know that it is the truth from their Sustainer &ndash; whereas those who are bent on denying the truth say, \"What could [your] God mean by this parable?\"\nIn this way does He cause many a one to go astray, just as He guides many a one aright: but none does He cause thereby to go astray save the iniquitous,",

As for the believers, they know it is the truth from their Lord; but as for unbelievers, they say, What did God desire by this for a similitude?

  "en_tr_maududi": "Well, Allah is not ashamed to cite the similitude of a gnat or of something even more insignificant than this.{{28}} As for those who believe, they come to know from the same similitude that it is the Revelation from their Lord; but those who disbelieve, say, \"What does Allah mean by such similitudes?\"{{29}} Allah leads astray many and guides many to the right way by the same thing.{{30}} And He leads astray only those who disobey Allah;",

In 29:41, which was revealed before this Surah, the similitude of the Spider was used, and similarly in 22:73, there is the similitude of the fly. For similitudes taken from magnificent forces of nature, expressed in exalted language, see 2:19 above. To Allah all His creation has some special meaning appropriate to itself, and some of what we consider the lowest creatures have wonderful aptitude, e.g., the spider or the fly. Parables like these may be an occasion of stumbling to those \"who forsake the path\": in other words those who deliberately shut their eyes to Allah's Signs, and their Penalty is attributed to Allah, the Cause of all causes. But lest there should be misunderstanding, it is immediately added that the stumbling and offence only occur as the result of the sinner's own choice of the wrong course. Verses 26 and 27 form one sentence and should be read together.\" Forsaking the path\" is defined in 2:27; viz., breaking solemn covenants which the sinner's own soul had ratified, causing division among mankind, who were meant to be one brotherhood, and doing as much mischief as possible in the life on this earth, for the life beyond will be on another plane, where no rope will be given to evil."
