  "ar_text_clean": "ألم تر إلى الذين خرجوا من ديارهم وهم ألوف حذر الموت فقال لهم الله موتوا ثم أحياهم إن الله لذو فضل على الناس ولكن أكثر الناس لا يشكرون",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Didst thou not Turn by vision to those who abandoned their homes, though they were thousands (In number), for fear of death? Allah said to them: \"Die\": Then He restored them to life. For Allah is full of bounty to mankind, but Most of them are ungrateful.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Bethink thee (O Muhammad) of those of old, who went forth from their habitations in their thousands, fearing death, and Allah said unto them: Die; and then He brought them back to life. Lo! Allah is a Lord of Kindness to mankind, but most of mankind give not thanks.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Have you not considered those who went forth from their homes, for fear of death, and they were thousands, then Allah said to them, Die; again He gave them life; most surely Allah is Gracious to people, but most people are not grateful.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Did you (O Muhammad SAW) not think of those who went forth from their homes in thousands, fearing death? Allah said to them, \"Die\". And then He restored them to life. Truly, Allah is full of Bounty to mankind, but most men thank not.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Bethinkest thou not of those Who Went forth from their habitations, and they were in their thousands, to escape death Then Allah said unto them: die and thereafter quickened them. Verily Allah is Gracious unto men; albeit most men give not thanks.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Haven't you seen those who went out from their homes in their thousands cautious of death? Allah said to them: 'Die, ' and then He revived them. Surely, Allah is Bountiful to the people, but most people do not thank.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Hast thou not considered those who went forth from their homes fearful of death, though they were in thousands? Then God said to them, `die', then He gave them life; God is surely bounteous to men, but most men do not give thanks.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Hast thou not heard of those who went forth from their homes, and they were thousands, fearing death? And God said to them, 'Die', Then He brought them to life. Surely God is Gracious to men, but most men are not grateful.",
  "en_tr_asad": "ART THOU NOT aware of those who forsook their homelands in their thousands for fear of death &ndash; whereupon God said unto them, \"Die,\" and later brought them back to life? \nBehold, God is indeed limitless in His bounty unto man &ndash; but most people are ungrateful.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Hast thou not regarded those who went forth from their habitations in their thousands fearful of death? God said to them, Die! Then He gave them life. Truly God is bounteous to the people, but most of the people are not thankful.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Have{{265}} you ever reflected upon the case of those who fled their homes for fear of death, and they were thousands in number? So Allah said to them, \"Die\"; then He again gave them life.{{266}} Indeed Allah is bountiful to mankind, but most of the people are ungrateful.",

      "note": "We now return to the subject of Jihad, which we left at 2:214-216. We are to be under no illusion about it. If we are not prepared to fight for our faith, with our lives and all our resources, both our lives and our resources will be wiped out by our enemies. As to life, Allah gave it, and a coward is not likely to save it. It has happened again and again in history that men who tamely submitted to be driven from their homes although they were more numerous than their enemies, had the sentence of death pronounced on them for their cowardice, and they deserved it. But Allah gives further and further chances in His mercy. This is a lesson to every generation. The Commentators differ as to the exact episode referred to, but the wording is perfectly general, and so is the lesson to be learnt from it."

      "note": "After the conclusion of the injunctions relating to marital life, the Qur'an returns here to the problem of warfare in a just cause by alluding to people who - obviously under a hostile attack -\"forsook their homelands for fear of death\". Now, neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Tradition offers any indication as to who the people referred to in this verse may have been. The \"historical\" explanations given by some of the commentators are most contradictory; they seem to have been derived from Talmudic stories current at the time, and cannot be used in this context with any justification. We must, therefore, assume (as Muhammad 'Abduh does in Manar II, 455 ff.) that the above allusion is parabolically connected with the subsequent call to the faithful to be ready to lay down their lives in God's cause: an illustration of the fact that fear of physical death leads to the moral death of nations and communities, just as their regeneration (or \"coming back to life\") depends on their regaining their moral status through overcoming the fear of death. This is undoubtedly the purport of the elliptic story of Samuel, Saul and David told in verses 246-251."
