  "en_tr_yusuf": "They have \"Obedience\" on their lips; but when they leave thee, a section of them Meditate all night on things very different from what thou tellest them. But Allah records their nightly (plots): So keep clear of them, and put thy trust in Allah, and enough is Allah as a disposer of affairs.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And they say: (It is) obedience; but when they have gone forth from thee a party of them spend the night in planning other than what thou sayest. Allah recordeth what they plan by night. So oppose them and put thy trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as Trustee.",

  "en_tr_sher": "And they say, 'Obedience is our guiding principle;' but when they go forth from thy presence, a section of them spends the night scheming against what thou hast said.

  "en_tr_maududi": "They say (in your presence): 'We obey', but when they leave your presence a party of them meets by night to plan against what you have said. Allah takes note of all their plots. So, let them alone, and put your trust in Allah. Allah is sufficient as a guardian.",
