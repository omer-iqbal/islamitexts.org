      "note": "The suggestion of the Evil One is clever, as it always is: it is false, and at the same time plausible. It is false, because (1) that felicity was not temporary, like the life of this world, and (2) they were supreme in the Garden, and a \"kingdom\" such as was dangled before them would only add to their sorrows. It was plausible, because (1) nothing had been said to them about Eternity, as the opposite of Eternity was not yet known, and (2) the sweets of Power arise from the savour of Self, and Self is an alluring (if false) attraction that misleads the Will."

      "note": "This symbolic tree is designated in the Bible as \"the tree of life\" and \"the tree of knowledge of good and evil\" (Genesis ii, 9), while in the above Qur'anic account Satan speaks of it as \"the tree of life eternal (al-khuld)\". Seeing that Adam and Eve did not achieve immortality despite their tasting the forbidden fruit, it is obvious that Satan's suggestion was, as it always is, deceptive. On the other hand, the Qur'an tells us nothing about the real nature of that \"tree\" beyond pointing out that it was Satan who described it - falsely - as \"the tree of immortality\": and so we may assume that the forbidden tree is simply an allegory of the limits which the Creator has set to man's desires and actions: limits beyond which he may not go without offending against his own, God-willed nature. Man's desire for immortality on earth implies a wishful denial of death and resurrection, and thus of the ultimate reality of what the Qur'an describes as \"the hereafter\" or \"the life to come\" (al-akhirah). This desire is intimately connected with Satan's insinuation that it is within man's reach to become the master of \"a kingdom that will never decay\": in other words, to become \"free\" of all limitations and thus, in the last resort, of the very concept of God - the only concept which endows human life with real meaning and purpose."
