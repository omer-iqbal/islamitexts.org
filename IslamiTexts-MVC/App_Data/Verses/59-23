(3) \"Salam\" has not only the idea of Peace as opposed to Conflict, but wholeness as opposed to defects: hence our paraphrase \"Source of Peace and Perfection\".

(5) \"Preserver of Safety\": guarding all from danger, corruption, loss, etc.: the word is used for the Qur'an in 5:48. These are the attributes of kindness and benevolence: in the next note are described the attributes of power."
