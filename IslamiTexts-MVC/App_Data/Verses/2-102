  "en_tr_yusuf": "They followed what the evil ones gave out (falsely) against the power of Solomon: the blasphemers Were, not Solomon, but the evil ones, teaching men Magic, and such things as came down at babylon to the angels Harut and Marut. But neither of these taught anyone (Such things) without saying: \"We are only for trial; so do not blaspheme.\" They learned from them the means to sow discord between man and wife. But they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's permission. And they learned what harmed them, not what profited them. And they knew that the buyers of (magic) would have no share in the happiness of the Hereafter. And vile was the price for which they did sell their souls, if they but knew!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And follow that which the devils falsely related against the kingdom of Solomon. Solomon disbelieved not; but the devils disbelieved, teaching mankind magic and that which was revealed to the two angels in Babel, Harut and Marut. Nor did they (the two angels) teach it to anyone till they had said: We are only a temptation, therefore disbelieve not (in the guidance of Allah). And from these two (angles) people learn that by which they cause division between man and wife; but they injure thereby no-one save by Allah's leave. And they learn that which harmeth them and profiteth them not. And surely they do know that he who trafficketh therein will have no (happy) portion in the Hereafter; and surely evil is the price for which they sell their souls, if they but knew.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And they followed what the Shaitans chanted of sorcery in the reign of Sulaiman, and Sulaiman was not an unbeliever, but the Shaitans disbelieved, they taught men sorcery and that was sent down to the two angels at Babel, Harut and Marut, yet these two taught no man until they had said, \"Surely we are only a trial, therefore do not be a disbeliever.\" Even then men learned from these two, magic by which they might cause a separation between a man and his wife; and they cannot hurt with it any one except with Allah's permission, and they learned what harmed them and did not profit them, and certainly they know that he who bought it should have no share of good in the hereafter and evil was the price for which they sold their souls, had they but known this.",

Sulaiman did not disbelieve, but the Shayatin (devils) disbelieved, teaching men magic and such things that came down at Babylon to the two angels, Harut and Marut, but neither of these two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till they had said, \"We are only for trial, so disbelieve not (by learning this magic from us).\" And from these (angels) people learn that by which they cause separation between man and his wife, but they could not thus harm anyone except by Allah's Leave. And they learn that which harms them and profits them not. And indeed they knew that the buyers of it (magic) would have no share in the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was that for which they sold their ownselves, if they but knew.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And they follow that which the Satans recited in the reign of Sulaiman; and Sulaiman blasphemed not, but the Satans blasphemed.; teaching people magic; and they follow that also which was sent down unto the two angels in Babil, Harut, and Marut. Unto none the twain taught it until they had said: We are but a temptation, so blaspheme not;  but they learned from the twain that wherewith they might separate man from his wife; and they could harm none thereby save by Allah's will. And they have learnt that which harmeth them, and profiteth them not; and assuredly they know that whosoever purchaseth it, his is no portion in the Hereafter. And surely vile is the price for which they have bartered themselves, if they but knew!",
  "en_tr_qarib": "and follow what the devils recited over the Kingdom of Solomon. Solomon did not disbelieve, it is the devils who disbelieved, teaching people magic and that which was sent down upon the angels Harut and Marut in Babylon. They did not teach anyone, until both had said: 'We have been sent as a trial; do not disbelieve. ' From them they learned how they might separate a husband and his wife. However, they did not harm anyone with it, except by the permission of Allah. Indeed, they learned what harms them and does not profit them, yet they knew that anyone who buys it would have no share in the Everlasting Life. Evil is that for which they have sold their souls, if they but knew!",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And they followed what the devils recited over Solomon's kingdom; and Solomon did not disbelieve (the Book) but the devils disbelieved, teaching the people sorcery and that which was sent down on the two angels in Babylon, Harut and Marut; and they (two) did not teach anyone, until they said, `we are only a trial, so do not disbelieve.' And they learnt from them that by which they might cause division between man and his wife; yet they could not hurt anyone except by the leave of God; and they learnt what hurt them and did not profit them; and they knew that whoso bought it shall have no share in the Hereafter; and evil indeed was that for which they sold themselves, if they had but known.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And they pursue the course which was pursued by the rebellious men against the Kingdom of Solomon. And Solomon did not disbelieve; but it was the rebellious ones who disbelieved. They taught people falsehood and deception, and they claim that they follow what was revealed to the two angels in Babylon, Har?t and Mar?t. But these two taught no one anything until they had said, 'We are but a trial from God, do not, therefore, reject what we say.' So men learnt from them that by which they made a distinction between man and his wife, but they harmed no one thereby, except by the command of God; on the contrary, these people (the opponents of the Holy Prophet) are learning that which would harm them and do them no good. And they have certainly known that he who traffics therein has no share of good in the Hereafter; and surely evil is that for which they sold their souls; if only they knew.",
  "en_tr_asad": "and follow [instead] that which the evil ones used to practice during Solomon's reign &ndash; for it was not Solomon who denied the truth, but those evil ones denied it by teaching people sorcery &ndash; and [they follow] that which has come down through the two angels in Babylon, H&#257;r&#363;t and M&#257;r&#363;t &ndash; although these two never taught it to anyone without first declaring, \"We are but a temptation to evil: do not, then, deny [God's] truth!\" And they learn from these two how to create discord between a man and his wife; but whereas they can harm none thereby save by God's leave, they acquire a knowledge that only harms themselves and does not benefit them &ndash; although they know, indeed, that he who acquires this [knowledge] shall have no share in the good of the life to come.

  "en_tr_arberry": "and they follow what the Satans recited over Solomons kingdom. Solomon disbelieved not, but the Satans disbelieved, teaching the people sorcery, and that which was sent down upon Babylons two angels, Harut and Marut; they taught not any man, without they said, We are but a temptation; do not disbelieve. From them they learned how they might divide a man and his wife, yet they did not hurt any man thereby, save by the leave of God, and they learned what hurt them, and did not profit them, knowing well that whoso buys it shall have no share in the world to come; evil then was that they sold themselves for, if they had but known.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "(Instead of this,) they began to follow that (magic) to which the devils falsely attributed (the greatness of) the kingdom of Solomon.{{104}} In fact Solomon was never involved in any practice of disbelief, but the satans, who taught magic to the people were themselves guilty of disbelief. They were after that thing which was sent to Harut and Marut, the two angels at Babylon. Whenever these two angels taught black art to anyone, they would always give a clear warning beforehand, saying, \"We are merely a trial for you; so you should not commit blasphemy.{{105}} But in spite of this warning, those people used to learn from the angels the art which caused division between husband and wife.{{106}} Although it was obvious that they could not do any harm to anyone by means of this magic without Allah's permission, yet they learnt that art which could not be profitable even for them but was actually harmful. Moreover, they knew it full well that anyone, who purchased that art, would have no share in the Hereafter. What a vile commodity it was for which they sold off their souls, if they had but known it!",

Being good men, Harut and Marut of course dabbled in nothing evil, and their hands were certainly clean of fraud. But knowledge and the arts, if learned by evil men, can be applied to evil uses. The evil ones, besides their fraudulent magic, also learnt a little of this true science and applied it to evil uses. Harut and Marut did not withhold knowledge, yet never taught anyone without plainly warning them of the trial and temptation of knowledge in the hands of evil men. Being men of insight, they also saw the blasphemy that might rise to the lips of the evil ones puffed up with science and warned them against it. Knowledge is indeed a trial or temptation: if we are warned, we know its dangers: if Allah has endowed us with free will, we must be free to choose between the benefit and the danger.<br/>Among the Jewish traditions in the Midrash (Jewish Tafsirs) was a story of two angels who asked Allah's permission to come down to earth but succumbed to temptation, and were hung up by their feet at Babylon for punishment. Such stories about sinning angels who were cast down to punishment were believed in by the early Christians also. (See the Second Epistle of Peter 2:4, and the Epistle of Jude, verse 6). (R)."
