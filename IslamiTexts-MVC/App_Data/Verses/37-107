In a literal sense it implies that a fine sheep or ram was substituted symbolically. The figurative sense is even more important. It was indeed a great and momentous occasion, when two men, with concerted will, \"ranged themselves in the ranks\" of those to whom selfsacrifice in the service of Allah was the supreme thing in life. In this sense, said Jesus, \"he that loseth his life for my sake shall find it\", (Matt. 10:39). (R)."
