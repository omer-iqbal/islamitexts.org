  "ar_text_clean": "بل كذبوا بما لم يحيطوا بعلمه ولما يأتهم تأويله كذلك كذب الذين من قبلهم فانظر كيف كان عاقبة الظالمين",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof hath reached them: thus did those before them make charges of falsehood: but see what was the end of those who did wrong!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Nay, but they denied that, the knowledge whereof they could not compass, and whereof the interpretation (in events) hath not yet come unto them. Even so did those before them deny. Then see what was the consequence for the wrong-doers!",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Nay, they reject that of which they have no comprehensive knowledge, and the final sequel of it has not yet come to them; even thus did those before them reject (the truth); see then what was the end of the unjust.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Nay, they deny that; the knowledge whereof they could not compass and whereof the interpretation has not yet come unto them. Thus those before them did deny. Then see what was the end of the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.)!",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Aye! they have belied that of which the knowledge they comprehended not and of which the fulfilment hath not come to them. Likewise belied those who were before them; behold then in what wise hath been the end of the wrongdoers.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "They have belied that which they did not understand of its knowledge, nor has its interpretation reached them. Those who were before also belied. But see how was the end of the harmdoers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "No, but they have given lies to that whose knowledge they did not comprehend and whose interpretation has not yet come to them. So also cried lies those that were before them, now see how was the end of the wrong-doers.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Nay, but they have rejected that, full knowledge of which they did not compass nor has the true significance thereof yet come to them. In like manner did those before them reject the truth. But see what was the end of the wrongdoers.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Nay, but they are bent on giving the lie to everything the wisdom whereof they do not comprehend, and ere its inner meaning has become clear to them. Even thus did those who lived before their time give the lie to the truth: and behold what happened in the end to those evildoers!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "No; but they have cried lies to that whereof they comprehended not the knowledge, and whose interpretation has not yet come to them. Even so those that were before them cried lies; then behold how was the end of the evildoers!",
  "en_tr_maududi": "In fact they arbitrarily rejected as false whatever they failed to comprehend and whose final sequel was not apparent to them.{{47}} Likewise had their predecessors rejected the truth, declaring it falsehood. Do observe, then, what was the end of the wrong-doers.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Nay, they charge with falsehood that whose knowledge they cannot compass, even before the elucidation thereof{{1431}} hath reached them: thus did those before them make charges of falsehood: but see what was the end of those who did wrong!{{1432}}",
  "en_ctr_asad": "Nay, but they are bent on giving the lie to everything the wisdom whereof they do not comprehend, and ere its inner meaning has become clear to them{{63}} Even thus did those who lived before their time give the lie to the truth: and behold what happened in the end to those evildoers!",
