      "note": "The word sadid is an infinitive noun of sadda. which in its primary meaning denotes \"he turned away\" or \"was averse [from something]\"; also - as noted in the Qamus and the Asas - \"he cried out loudly\" (i.e., by reason of his aversion to something). Since sadid signifies anything that is repulsive, it is also used tropically to describe the pus that flows from wounds or the viscous liquid that oozes from corpses. In his commentary on this verse, Razi suggests that the expression ma' sadid is here purely metaphorical, and should be understood as \"water like [what is described as] sadid\". It is in pursuance of this interpretation that I have rendered the above expression as \"waters of most bitter distress\" - a metaphor of the boundless suffering and bitter frustration which, in the life to come, awaits those who during their life in this world were bent on denying all spiritual truths. (Cf. the expression sharab min hamim - rendered by me as \"a draught of burning despair\" - occurring in several places and elucidated in note 62 on 6:70.)"
