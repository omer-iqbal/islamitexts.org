In the first place, it refers to their negative state, their state of isolation. From this Day of Judgement, they will no longer have the chance of being with the Blessed and perhaps of profiting spiritually by that proximity. The first feature of the Day of Judgement is that it is a Day of Separation-of sorting out. Each soul now finds its own true level, as the period of probation is over."
