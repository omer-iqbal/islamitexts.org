  "en_tr_yusuf": "O ye who believe! Be ye helpers of Allah: As said Jesus the son of Mary to the Disciples, \"Who will be my helpers to (the work of) Allah?\" Said the disciples, \"We are Allah's helpers!\" then a portion of the Children of Israel believed, and a portion disbelieved: But We gave power to those who believed, against their enemies, and they became the ones that prevailed.",

Badr (A.H. 2) was a landmark against Pagan Arabia: Qadisiyah (A.H. 14) and Mada'in (A.H. 16) against the might of Persia: Yarmuk (A.H. 15) against the might of the Byzantine Empire in Christian Syria; and Heliopolis (A.H. 19) against the same Empire in Christian Egypt and Africa. These were symbols in external events. The moral and spiritual landmarks are less tangible, and more gradual, but none the less real. Mark how the arrogance and power of Priesthood have been quelled; how superstition and belief in blind Fate have been checked; how the freedom of human individuals has been reconciled with the sanctity of marriage in the Law of Divorce, how the civil position of women has been raised; how temperance and sobriety have been identified with religion; what impetus has been given to knowledge and experimental science; and how economic reconstruction has been pioneered by rational schemes for the expenditure and distribution of wealth."
