  "en_tr_sher": "Would you question the Messenger sent to you as Moses was questioned before this? And whoever takes disbelief in exchange for belief has undoubtedly gone astray from the right path.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Would you, perchance, ask of the Apostle who has been sent unto you what was asked aforetime of Moses? But whoever chooses to deny the [evidence of the] truth, instead of believing in it, has already strayed from the right path.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Or do you desire to question your Messenger as Moses was questioned in former time? Whoso exchanges belief for unbelief has surely strayed from the right way.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Would you then ask your Prophet such questions as were asked of Moses in former times?{{110}} In fact, anyone, who changes the way of belief for that of disbelief, has surely swerved from the Right way.",
