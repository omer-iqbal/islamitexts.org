Occasionally, however, it is used to describe the medium through which such inspiration is imparted to God's elect: in other words, the angel (or angelic force) of revelation. Since - as is implied in 6:9 - mortals cannot perceive an angel in his true manifestation, God caused him to appear to Mary \"in the shape of a well-made human being\", i.e., in a shape accessible to her perception. According to Razi, the designation of the angel as ruh (\"spirit\" or \"soul\") indicates that this category of beings is purely spiritual, without any physical element."
