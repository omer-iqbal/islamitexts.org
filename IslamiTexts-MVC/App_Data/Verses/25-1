The English word \"blessed\" hardly conveys that meaning, but I can find no other without departing far from established usage. To emphasise the meaning I have explained, I have translated \"Blessed is . . .\", but \"Blessed be . . .\" is also admissible, as it brings out another shade of meaning, that we praise and bless His Holy Name."
