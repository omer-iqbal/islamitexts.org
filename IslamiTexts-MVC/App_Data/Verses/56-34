The rendering adopted by me is regarded as fully justified by some of the most outstanding commentators (e.g., Baghawi, Zamakhshari, Razi, Baydawi, etc.), and this for two reasons: firstly, because in the classical Arabic idiom, the term firash (lit., \"bed\" or \"couch\") is often used tropically to denote \"wife\" or \"husband\" (Raghib; also Qamus, Taj al-'Arus, etc.); and, secondly, because of the statement in the next verse that God \"shall have brought them (hunna) into being in a life renewed\" (In the context of this interpretation, Zamakhshari quotes also 36:56, which thus refers to the inmates of paradise: ... in happiness will they and their spouses on couches recline\". There is no doubt that the \"spouses raised high\" i.e., to the status of the blest - are identical with the hur mentioned in verse 22 above as well as in 44:54, 52:20 and 65:72."
