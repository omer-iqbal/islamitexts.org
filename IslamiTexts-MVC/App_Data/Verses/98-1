Their scriptures should have prepared them for the advent of the greatest and last of the Prophets.

And Christ promised a Comforter (John, 14:16; 15:26; and 16:7; see my n. 5438 to 61:6) almost by name. The People of the Book fell from the true, straight, and standard religion, into devious ways, and would not come to the true Path until (they said) they were convinced by the arrival of the promised Prophet. But when the promised Prophet came in the person of Muhammad, they rejected him, because they really did not seek for Truth but only followed their own fancies and desires."
