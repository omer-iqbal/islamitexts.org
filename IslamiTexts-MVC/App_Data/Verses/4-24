  "en_tr_pickth": "And all married women (are forbidden unto you) save those (captives) whom your right hands possess. It is a decree of Allah for you. Lawful unto you are all beyond those mentioned, so that ye seek them with your wealth in honest wedlock, not debauchery. And those of whom ye seek content (by marrying them), give unto them their portions as a duty. And there is no sin for you in what ye do by mutual agreement after the duty (hath been done). Lo!

According to almost all the authorities, al-muhsanat denotes in the above context \"married women\". As for the expression ma malakat aymanukum (\"those whom your right hands possess\", i.e., \"those whom you rightfully possess\"), it is often taken to mean female slaves captured in a war in God's cause (see in this connection 8:67, and the corresponding note). The commentators who choose this meaning hold that such slave-girls can be taken in marriage irrespective of whether they have husbands in the country of their origin or not. However, quite apart from the fundamental differences of opinion, even among the Companions of the Prophet, regarding the legality of such a marriage, some of the most outstanding commentators hold the view that ma malakat aymanukum denotes here \"women whom you rightfully possess through wedlock\"; thus Razi in his commentary on this verse, and Tabari in one of his alternative explanations (going back to Abd Allah ibn Abbas, Mujahid, and others). Razi, in particular, points out that the reference to \"all married women\" (al-muhsanat min an-nisa'), coming as it does after the enumeration of prohibited degrees of relationship, is meant to stress the prohibition of sexual relations with any woman other than one's lawful wife."
