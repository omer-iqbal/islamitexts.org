  "en_tr_yusuf": "Are they waiting to see if the angels come to them, or thy Lord (Himself), or certain of the signs of thy Lord! the day that certain of the signs of thy Lord do come, no good will it do to a soul to believe in them then if it believed not before nor earned righteousness through its faith. Say: \"Wait ye: we too are waiting.\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Wait they, indeed, for nothing less than that the angels should come unto them, or thy Lord should come, or there should come one of the portents from thy Lord?

We (too) are waiting.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "They do not wait aught but that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the signs of your Lord should come. On the day when some of the signs of your Lord shall come, its faith shall not profit a soul which did not believe before, or earn good through its faith. Say: Wait; we too are waiting.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Do they then wait for anything other than that the angels should come to them, or that your Lord should come, or that some of the Signs of your Lord should come (i.e. portents of the Hour e.g., arising of the sun from the west)! The day that some of the Signs of your Lord do come, no good will it do to a person to believe then, if he believed not before, nor earned good (by performing deeds of righteousness) through his Faith. Say: \"Wait you! we (too) are waiting.\"",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "They await indeed that the angel should come unto them, or that thy Lord should come or that certain of the signs of thy Lord should come. On the Day whereon certain of the signs of thy Lord will come, belief will not profit any person who had not believed theretofore or had not earned any good by his belief. Say thou: so wait ye verily we also are waiting.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Are they waiting for the angels or your Lord to come to them, or for some of the signs of your Lord? On the Day when some of the signs of your Lord come, no soul will be benefited by its belief had it not believed before or earned good in its belief. Say: 'Wait, we are waiting. '",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Are they only looking for the angels to come to them, or for thy Lord to come, or for some of the Signs of thy Lord to come? On the day some of the Signs of thy Lord come, it shall not profit a soul to believe, if it did not believe before, or earned some good in its belief. Say, `wait, we are also waiting'.",
  "en_tr_sher": "They are but waiting that angels should come to them or that thy Lord should come or there should come some of the Signs of thy Lord.

  "en_tr_asad": "Do they, perchance, wait for the angels to appear unto them, or for thy Sustainer [Himself] to appear, or for some of thy Sustainer's [final] portents to appear?

  "en_tr_arberry": "What, do they look for the angels to come to them, nothing less, or that thy Lord should come, or that one of thy Lords signs should come? On the day that one of thy Lords signs comes it shall not profit a soul to believe that never believed before, or earned some good in his belief. Say: Watch and wait; We too are waiting.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "What! Do they wait either for the angels to appear before them or for your Lord to come unto them or for some clear signs of your Lord{{139}} to appear before them?
