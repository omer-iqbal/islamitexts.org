The works of such are in vain and in Fire shall they abide.",

For brevity I have only used the two words \"visit and maintain\" in the translation.<br/>Before the preaching of Islam the Pagans built, repaired, and maintained the Mosque, and celebrated Pagan ceremonies in it, including naked circumambulation round the Ka'bah. They made an income out of it. Islam protested, and the Pagans ejected Muslims and their Leader from Makkah, and shut them out from the Ka'bah itself. When the Muslims were strong enough to retake Makkah (A. H. 8), they purified the Mosque and reestablished the worship of the true God. The families who previously held control could not after this be allowed in a state of Paganism to control the Mosque any longer. If they became Muslims, it was a different matter. The further question arose: should they be allowed to visit it and practise their unseemly Pagan rites? Obviously this would be derogatory to the dignity and honour of the Mosque, and was forbidden. This was the particular occasion to which the verse refers. The general deduction is clear. A house of Allah is a place of sincere devotion, not a theatre for vulgar rites nor a source of worldly income. Only sincere Believers have a right of entry. Who the sincere Believers are, is explained in the next verse."

This conclusion, however, is entirely untenable in view of the fact that in 9 H. - that is, after the revelation of this surah - the Prophet himself lodged a deputation of the pagan Band Thaqif in the mosque at Medina (Razi). Thus, the above verse expresses no more than the moral incongruity of the unbelievers' \"visiting or tending God's houses of worship\". As regards their exclusion from the central mosque of Islam at Mecca (\"the Inviolable House of Worship\"), see verse 28 of this surah."
