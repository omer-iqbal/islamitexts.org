  "en_tr_yusuf": "And the Hypocrites also. These were told: \"Come, fight in the way of Allah, or (at least) drive (The foe from your city).\" They said: \"Had we known how to fight, we should certainly have followed you.\" They were that day nearer to Unbelief than to Faith, saying with their lips what was not in their hearts but Allah hath full knowledge of all they conceal.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And that He might know the hypocrites, unto whom it was said: Come, fight in the way of Allah, or defend yourselves.

Allah is Best Aware of what they hide.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And that He might know the hypocrites; and it was said to them: Come, fight in Allah's way, or defend yourselves.

They say with their mouths that which is not in their hearts  and Allah knoweth best that which they conceal.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "and that He might know the hypocrites. ' When it was said to them: 'Come, fight or repel in the way of Allah. ' They replied: 'If only we knew how to fight, we would follow you.

  "en_tr_sher": "And that He might cause the hypocrites to be distinguished. And it was said to them, 'Come ye, fight in the cause of God and repel the attack of the enemy;' they said, 'If we knew how to fight we would surely follow you.'

  "en_tr_arberry": "and that He might also know the hypocrites when it was said of them, Come now, fight in the way of God, or repel! They said, If only we knew how to fight, we would follow you.

In the first place they gave counsels of caution: in their minds it was nothing but cowardice. In the second place, what they wished was not the good of the community but its being placed in a contemptible position. When the others were for self-sacrifice, they were for ease and fair words. Pretending to be Muslims, they were nearer to unbelief. Ironically they pretended to know nothing of fighting, and left their devout brethren to defend their faith and ideas. If that devout spirit did not appeal to them, they might at least have defended their city of Madinah when it was threatened-defended their hearths and homes as good citizens."
