This, according to some of the most outstanding commentators, relates to the parabolic expressions in the above three verses: the \"going to waste\" - in consequence of their deliberate \"pursuance of falsehood\" - of the good deeds of those who deny the truth, as well as the \"effacement of the bad deeds\" of the true believers in consequence of their \"pursuance of the truth\" (Baghawi, Zamakhshari, Razi, Baydawi). In a broader perspective, this interpretation takes into account the parabolic nature not only of the above sentence but also of many other Qur'anic statements relating to men's spiritual conditions and destinies in this world as well as in the life to come."
