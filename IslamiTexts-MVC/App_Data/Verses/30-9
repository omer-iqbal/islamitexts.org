  "ar_text_clean": "أولم يسيروا في الأرض فينظروا كيف كان عاقبة الذين من قبلهم كانوا أشد منهم قوة وأثاروا الأرض وعمروها أكثر مما عمروها وجاءتهم رسلهم بالبينات فما كان الله ليظلمهم ولكن كانوا أنفسهم يظلمون",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength: they tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have done: there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs). (Which they rejected, to their own destruction): It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Have they not travelled in the land and seen the nature of the consequence for those who were before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they dug the earth and built upon it more than these have built. Messengers of their own came unto them with clear proofs (of Allah's Sovereignty). Surely Allah wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these in prowess, and dug up the earth, and built on it in greater abundance than these have built on it, and there came to them their messengers with clear arguments; so it was not beseeming for Allah that He should deal with them unjustly, but they dealt unjustly with their own souls.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Do they not travel in the land, and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength, and they tilled the earth and populated it in greater numbers than these (pagans) have done, and there came to them their Messengers with clear proofs. Surely, Allah wronged them not, but they used to wrong themselves.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Have they not journeyed in the land and observed what wise hath been the end of those before them? They were stronger than they in power and they brake up the earth and they inhabited it with greater affluence than these have inhabited it, and their apostles came unto them with evidences. And Allah was not one to wrong them, but themselves they were wont to wrong.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "What, have they never journeyed in the land and seen what was the end of those before them? They were stronger in might than themselves, and they plowed the land and cultivated it more than they themselves have cultivated it. And to them, their Messengers came with clear signs, and Allah did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And have they not journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than these in might, and they ploughed the land and cultivated it more than these cultivated it, and their Messengers came to them with the Clear Signs; and God was not such as would wrong them, but themselves they wronged.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Have they not traveled in the earth so that they might see how evil was the end of those who were before them? They were stronger than these in power, and they tilled the soil and populated it more and better than these have populated it. And their Messengers came to them with manifest Signs. And God would not wrong them, but they wronged their own souls.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Have they, then, never journeyed about the earth and beheld what happened in the end to those [deniers of the truth] who lived before their time? Greater were they in power than they are; and they left a stronger impact on the earth, and built it up even better than these [are doing]; and to them [too] came their apostles with all evidence of the truth: and so, [when they rejected the truth and thereupon perished,] it was not God who wronged them, but it was they who had wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "What, have they not journeyed in the land and beheld how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than themselves in might, and they ploughed up the earth and cultivated it more than they themselves have cultivated it; and their Messengers came to them with the clear signs; and God would never wrong them, but themselves they wronged.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Have they not travelled through the earth that they may observe what was the end of their predecessors{{8}} who were far mightier and tilled the land{{9}} and built upon it more than these have ever built?{{10}} And Allah's Messengers came to them with Clear Signs.{{11}} It was not Allah Who wronged them, but it is they who wronged themselves.{{12}}",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Do they not travel through the earth, and see what was the end of those before them? They were superior to them in strength: they tilled the soil and populated it in greater numbers than these have done: there came to them their messengers with Clear (Signs).{{3515}} (Which they rejected, to their own destruction): It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged their own souls.",
