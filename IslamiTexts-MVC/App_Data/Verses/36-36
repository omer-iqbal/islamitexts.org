(It is to be borne in mind that the noun zawj denotes both \"a pair\" and \"one of a pair\", as explained in note 7 on 13:3.) The mention of \"that of which they have no knowledge\" evidently relates to things or phenomena not yet understood by man but potentially within the range of his comprehension: hence my interpolation, between brackets, of the words \"as yet\"."
