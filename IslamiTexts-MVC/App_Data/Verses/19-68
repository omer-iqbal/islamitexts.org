The symbolism of the sinners being linked on Judgment Day \"with the satanic forces which impelled them in life\" is easily understood if we remember - as has been pointed out in note 10 on 2:14 - that the term shaytan (\"satan\" or \"satanic force\") is often used in the Qur'an to describe every evil propensity in man's own self.
