  "en_tr_yusuf": "And We have destined for them intimate companions (of like nature), who made alluring to them what was before them and behind them; and the sentence among the previous generations of Jinns and men, who have passed away, is proved against them; for they are utterly lost.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And We assigned them comrades (in the world), who made their present and their past fairseeming unto them. And the Word concerning nations of the jinn and humankind who passed away before them hath effect for them. Lo! they were ever losers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And We have appointed for them comrades so they have made fair-seeming to them what is before them and what is behind them, and the word proved true against them-- among the nations of the jinn and the men that have passed away before them-- that they shall surely be losers.",

  "en_tr_ayubk": "And We had assigned to them comrades who adorned for them what was before them and what was behind them, so the Word against them has been realized as it was for the communities of men and the jinn that passed away before them; surely they were the losers.",

Surely, they were the losers.",
  "en_tr_asad": "for [when they became oblivious of Us,] We assigned to them [their own evil impulses as their] other selves, and these made appear goodly to them whatever lay open before them and whatever was beyond their ken. \nAnd so, the sentence [of doom] will have fallen due upon them together with the [other sinful] communities of invisible beings and humans that passed away before their time: verily, they [all] will indeed be lost!",
