      "note": "Lit., \"that there will come to you the heart\". The word tabut - here rendered as \"heart\" - has been conventionally interpreted as denoting the Ark of the Covenant mentioned in the Old Testament, which is said to have been a highly-ornamented chest or box. The explanations offered by most of the commentators who adopt the latter meaning are very contradictory, and seem to be based on Talmudic legends woven around that \"ark\". However, several authorities of the highest standing attribute to tabut the meaning of \"bosom\" or \"heart\" as well: thus, Baydawi in one of the alternatives offered in his commentary on this verse, as well as Zamakhshari in his Asas (though not in the Kashshaf), Ibn al-Athir in the Nihdyah, Raghib, and Taj al-Arus (the latter four in the article tabata); see also Lane I, 321, and IV, 1394 (art. sakfnah). If we take this to be the meaning of tabut in the above context, it would be an allusion to the Israelites' coming change of heart (a change already indicated, in general terms, in verse 243 above). In view of the subsequent mention of the \"inner peace\" in the tabut, its rendering as \"heart\" is definitely more appropriate than \"ark\"."
