  "ar_text_clean": "الذين يأكلون الربا لا يقومون إلا كما يقوم الذي يتخبطه الشيطان من المس ذلك بأنهم قالوا إنما البيع مثل الربا وأحل الله البيع وحرم الربا فمن جاءه موعظة من ربه فانتهى فله ما سلف وأمره إلى الله ومن عاد فأولئك أصحاب النار هم فيها خالدون",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Those who devour usury will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness. That is because they say: \"Trade is like usury,\" but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever).",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Those who swallow usury cannot rise up save as he ariseth whom the devil hath prostrated by (his) touch. That is because they say: Trade is just like usury; whereas Allah permitteth trading and forbiddeth usury. He unto whom an admonition from his Lord cometh, and (he) refraineth (in obedience thereto), he shall keep (the profits of) that which is past, and his affair (henceforth) is with Allah. As for him who returneth (to usury) - Such are rightful owners of the Fire. They will abide therein.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Those who swallow down usury cannot arise except as one whom Shaitan has prostrated by (his) touch does rise. That is because they say, trading is only like usury; and Allah has allowed trading and forbidden usury. To whomsoever then the admonition has come from his Lord, then he desists, he shall have what has already passed, and his affair is in the hands of Allah; and whoever returns (to it)-- these arc the inmates of the fire; they shall abide in it.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Those who eat Riba (usury) will not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except like the standing of a person beaten by Shaitan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That is because they say: \"Trading is only like Riba (usury),\" whereas Allah has permitted trading and forbidden Riba (usury). So whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and stops eating Riba (usury) shall not be punished for the past; his case is for Allah (to judge); but whoever returns [to Riba (usury)], such are the dwellers of the Fire - they will abide therein.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Those who devour Usury Shall not be able to stand except standeth one whom the Satan hath confounded with his touch. That shall be because they say: bargaining is but as usury whereas Allah hath allowed bargaining and hath forbidden usury. Wherefore Unto whomsoever an exhortation cometh from his Lord, and he desisteth, his is that which is past, and his affair is with Allah. And whosoever returnoth --such shall be the fellows of the Fire, therein they shall be abiders.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Those who consume usury shall not rise up (from their tomb) except as he who rises in madness that satan has touched. That is because they say: 'Selling is like usury. ' Allah has permitted trading and forbidden usury. To whomsoever an exhortation comes from his Lord then he desists, he shall have his past gains, and his matter is with Allah. But whoever reverts shall be among the people of the Fire and shall remain in it for ever.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Those who devour usury stand not but as stands one whom Devil has confounded with touch; that is because they say, `trading is only like usury'; but God has permitted trading and forbidden usury. Now to whom an admonition from his Lord reaches and he gives over, he may have what is past, and his affair is committed to God. But those who revert, they are the people of the Fire; they shall dwell therein forever.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Those who devour interest do not rise except as rises one whom Satan has smitten with insanity. That is because they say, 'Trade also is like interest;' whereas God has made trade lawful and has made interest unlawful. So he to whom an admonition comes from his Lord and he desist, then will that which he received in the pass be his; and his affair rests with God. And those who revert to it they are the inmates of the Fire; therein shall they abide.",
  "en_tr_asad": "THOSE who gorge themselves on usury behave but as he might behave whom Satan has confounded with his touch; for they say, \"Buying and selling is but a kind of usury\" &ndash; the while God has made buying and selling lawful and usury unlawful. Hence, whoever becomes aware of his Sustainer's admonition, and thereupon desists [from usury], may keep his past gains, and it will be for God to judge him; but as for those who return to it &ndash; they are destined for the fire, therein to abide!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Those who devour usury shall not rise again except as he rises, whom Satan of the touch prostrates; that is because they say, Trafficking (trade) is like usury. God has permitted trafficking, and forbidden usury. Whosoever receives an admonition from his Lord and gives over, he shall have his past gains, and his affair is committed to God; but whosoever reverts -- those are the inhabitants of the Fire, therein dwelling forever.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "But those who devour interest{{315}} become like the one whom Satan has bewitched and maddened by his touch.{{316}} They have been condemned to this condition because they say, \"Trade is just like interest\",{{317}} whereas Allah has made trade lawful and interest unlawful.{{318}} Henceforth, if one abstains from taking interest after receiving this admonition from his Lord, no legal action will be taken against him regarding the interest he had devoured before; his case shall ultimately go to Allah.{{319}} But if one repeats the same crime after this, he shall go to Hell, where he shall abide for ever.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Those who devour usury{{324}} will not stand except as stand one whom the Evil one by his touch Hath driven to madness{{325}}. That is because they say: \"Trade is like usury{{326}},\" but Allah hath permitted trade and forbidden usury. Those who after receiving direction from their Lord, desist, shall be pardoned for the past; their case is for Allah (to judge); but those who repeat (The offence) are companions of the Fire: They will abide therein (for ever).",
