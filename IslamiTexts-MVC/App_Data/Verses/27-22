It was a city in Yemen, said to have been three days journey (say 50 miles) from the city of San'a'. A (recent) German explorer, Dr. Ham Helfritz, claims to have located it in what is now Hadramawt territory. The famous dam of Ma'rib made the country very prosperous, and enabled it to attain a high degree of civilisation (\"provided with every requisite\" in the next verse). The Queen of Sheba therefore rightly held up her head high until she saw the glories of Solomon."
