  "en_tr_yusuf": "Nor are the two bodies of flowing water alike,- the one palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, and the other, salt and bitter. Yet from each (kind of water) do ye eat flesh fresh and tender, and ye extract ornaments to wear; and thou seest the ships therein that plough the waves, that ye may seek (thus) of the Bounty of Allah that ye may be grateful.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And the two seas are not alike: this, fresh, sweet, good to drink, this (other) bitter, salt. And from them both ye eat fresh meat and derive the ornament that ye wear. And thou seest the ship cleaving them with its prow that ye may seek of His bounty, and that haply ye may give thanks.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And the two seas are not alike: the one sweet, that subdues thirst by its excessive sweetness, pleasant to drink; and the other salt, that burns by its saltness; yet from each of them you eat fresh flesh and bring forth ornaments which you wear; and you see the ships cleave through it that you may seek of His bounty and that you may be grateful.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And the two seas (kinds of water) are not alike, this fresh sweet, and pleasant to drink, and that saltish and bitter.

  "en_tr_dbadi": "And the two seas are not alike: this, sweet, thirst-quenching, pleasant to drink;and that, saltish and bitter. And yet from each ye eat flesh fresh and bring forth the ornaments that ye wear. And thou seest therein ships cleaving the water, that ye may seek of His graCe, and that haply ye may give thanks.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "The two seas are not alike. One is fresh, sweet and pleasant to taste, while the other is salt and bitter. Yet, from each you eat fresh flesh and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear. And you see the ships plow their course through it so that you may seek His bounty, and in order that you give thanks.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And the two seas are not equal; this is sweet, fresh, to pleasant drink, and that is bitter salt; yet from each, you eat fresh flesh, and bring forth ornaments that you wear; and thou seest the ships ploughing through it, that you may seek of His bounty, and perhaps you will be thankful.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And the two seas are not alike: this one palatable, sweet and pleasant to drink and this other saltish, bitter. And yet from each you eat fresh meat, and take forth ornaments which you wear. And thou seest the ships therein ploughing the waves that you may seek of His bounty, and that you may be grateful.",
  "en_tr_asad": "[Easy is it for Him to create likeness and variety:] thus, the two great bodies of water [on earth] are not alike &ndash; the one sweet, thirst-allaying, pleasant to drink, and the other salty and bitter: and yet, from either of them do you eat fresh meat, and [from either] you take gems which you may wear; and on either thou canst see ships ploughing through the waves, so that you might [be able to] go forth in quest of some of His bounty, and thus have cause to be grateful.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Not equal are the two seas; this is sweet, grateful to taste, delicious to drink, and that is salt, bitter to the tongue. Yet of both you eat fresh flesh, and bring forth out of it ornaments for you to wear; and thou mayest see the ships cleaving through it, that you may seek of His bounty, and so haply you will be thankful.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "The two masses of water are not alike.{{27}} The one is sweet, sates thirst, and is pleasant to drink from, while the other is salt, bitter on the tongue. Yet from both you eat fresh meat,{{28}} and extract from it ornaments that you wear;{{29}} and you see ships cruising through it that you may seek of His Bounty and be thankful to Him.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Nor are the two bodies{{3888}} of flowing water alike,- the one palatable, sweet, and pleasant to drink, and the other, salt and bitter.
