For its association with Abraham, see 2:125 ff., and the corresponding notes. The noun ka'bah, by which, owing to its shape, the sanctuary has always been known, denotes any \"cubical building\". It would seem that he who first built the Ka'bah (for, since the time of Abraham, it has been rebuilt several times, always in the same shape) consciously chose the simplest three-dimensional form imaginable - a cube - as a parable of man's humility and awe before the idea of God, whose glory is beyond anything that man could conceive by way of architectural beauty. This symbolism is clearly expressed in the term giyam (lit., \"support\" or \"mainstay\"), which - in its abstract sense - signifies \"a standard by which [men's] affairs are made sound or improved\" (Razi): hence my rendering of qiyam li'n-nas as \"a symbol for all mankind\"."
