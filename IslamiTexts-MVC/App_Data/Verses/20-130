  "en_tr_pickth": "Therefor (O Muhammad), bear with what they say, and celebrate the praise of thy Lord ere the rising of the sun and ere the going down thereof. And glorify Him some hours of the night and at the two ends of the day, that thou mayst find acceptance.",

That does not mean that they should sit still and do nothing to destroy evil; for the fight against evil is one of the cardinal points of Islam.

If the day be compared to a tubular figure standing erect, the top and bottom are clearly marked, but the sides are not so clearly marked: they would be atraf (plural), not tarafayn (dual). Now the prayer before sunrise is clearly Fajr t that before sunset is 'Asr: \"part of the hours of the night\" would indicate Maghrib (early night, just after sunset), and 'Isha, before going to bed. There is left Zuhr, which is the indefinite side or middle of the day; it may be soon after the sun's decline from noon, but there is considerable latitude about the precise hour. The majority of Commentators interpret in favour of the five Canonical prayers, and some include optional prayers. But I think the words are even more comprehensive. A good man's life is all one sweet Song of Praise to Allah (Cf. 3521)-"
