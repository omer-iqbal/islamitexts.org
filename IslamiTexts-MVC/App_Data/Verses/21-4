Qul is the reading of the Basrah Qim'ah, meaning, \"Say thou\" in the imperative. If we construe \"he says\", the pronoun refers to \"this (one)\" in the preceding verse, viz.: the Prophet. But more than one Commentator understands the meaning in the imperative, and I agree with them. The point is merely one of verbal construction. The meaning is the same in either case. See n. 2948 to 23:112. (R)."

In the earliest copies of the Qur'an the spelling was apparently confined, in this instance, to the consonants q-1: hence the possibility of reading it either as qui or as qala. However, as Tabari points out, both these readings have the same meaning and are, therefore, equally valid, \"for, when God bade Muhammad to say this, he [undoubtedly] said it ... Hence, in whichever way this word is read, the reader is correct (musib as-sawab) in his reading.\" Among the classical commentators, Baghawi and Baydawi explicitly use the spelling qul, while Zamakhshari's short remark that \"it has also been read as qala\" seems to indicate his own preference for the imperative qul."
