  "en_tr_hilali": "And on the Day that the Hour will be established, the Mujrimun (criminals, disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, etc.) will swear that they stayed not but an hour, thus were they ever deluded [away from the truth (i.e they used to tell lies and take false oaths, and turn away from the truth) in this life of the world)].",

They were deluded by the fact that what they took to be their triumph or their freedom to do what they liked was only a reprieve, a \"Term Appointed\", in which they could repent and amend and get Allah's Mercy. Failing this, they will then be up against the Penalties which they thought they had evaded or defied."

In the above context stress is laid, firstly, on the relativity of this concept - i.e., on the infinitesimal shortness of our life on earth as compared with the timeless duration of life in the hereafter (cf. for instance, 10:45 or 17:52) - and, secondly, on the resurrected sinners' self-deluding excuse that their life on earth had been too short to allow them to realize their errors and mend their ways. It is to this second aspect of the problem that the Qur'an alludes in the \"words, \"thus were they wont to delude themselves\" (lit., \"to be turned away\", i.e., from the truth). For an explanation of the verb yu'fikun, see surah 5, note 90."
