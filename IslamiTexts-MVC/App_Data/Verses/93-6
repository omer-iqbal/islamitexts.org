      "note": "(1) There is the case of the orphan, literally and figuratively. Our Prophet was himself an orphan. His father 'Abd Allah died young before the child was born, leaving no property. The Prophet's mother Aminah was in ailing health, and he was chiefly brought up by his nurse Halimah. His mother herself died when he was only six years old. His aged grandfather 'Abd al Muttalib treated him as his own son, but died two years later. Thereafter his uncle Abu Talib treated him as his own son. He was thus an orphan in more senses than one, and yet the love he received from each one pf these persons was greater than ordinary parental love. Each one of us is an orphan in some sense or another, and yet someone's love and shelter come to us by the grace of Allah. In the spiritual world there is no father or mother: our very first sustenance and shelter must come from the grace of Allah."
