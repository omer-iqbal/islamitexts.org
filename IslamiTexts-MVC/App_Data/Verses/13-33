  "en_tr_yusuf": "Is then He who standeth over every soul (and knoweth) all that it doth, (like any others)? And yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: \"But name them! is it that ye will inform Him of something he knoweth not on earth, or is it (just) a show of words?\" Nay! to those who believe not, their pretence seems pleasing, but they are kept back (thereby) from the path. And those whom Allah leaves to stray, no one can guide.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Is He Who is aware of the deserts of every soul (as he who is aware of nothing)? Yet they ascribe unto Allah partners. Say: Name them. Is it that ye would inform Him of something which He knoweth not in the earth? Or is it but a way of speaking? Nay but their contrivance is made seeming fair for those who disbelieve and they are kept from the right road. He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Is He then Who watches every soul as to what it earns? And yet they give associates to Allah! Say: Give them a name; nay, do you mean to inform Him of what He does not know in the earth, or (do you affirm this) by an outward saying? Rather, their plans are made to appear fair-seeming to those who disbelieve, and they are kept back from the path; and whom Allah makes err, he shall have no guide.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge (guards, maintains, provides, etc.) of every person and knows all that he has earned (like any other deities who know nothing)? Yet they ascribe partners to Allah. Say: \"Name them! Is it that you will inform Him of something He knows not in the earth or is it (just) a show of false words.\" Nay! To those who disbelieve, their plotting is made fairseeming, and they have been hindered from the Right Path, and whom Allah sends astray, for him, there is no guide.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Is He, then, who is ever standing over every soul with that which he earneth, like unto other! And yet they have set up associates unto Allah. Say thou: name them; would ye inform Him of that which He knoweth not on the earth? or is it by way of outward saying? Aye! fair-seeming unto those who disbelieve is made their plotting, and they have been hindered from the way.And whomsoever  sendeth astray, for him there is no guide.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "What, He who stands over every soul for what it has earned, yet they made partners for Allah. Say: 'Name them. Or would you tell Him of that which is unknown in the earth to Him? Or in outward speech only? ' Indeed, their devising seems fair to the unbelievers, for they are barred from the Right Way. None can guide those whom Allah leads astray.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Is then He who stands over every soul for what it has earnsed__but they have assigned associates to God. Say, `name them, or do you tell Him what He does not know in the earth, or in apparent words?' No, but to the unbelievers, their devising seems fair and they are barred from the way; and whomso God sends astray, no guide has he.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Will then He, Who stands over every soul watching what it earns, let them go unpunished? Yet they ascribe partners to God. Say, 'Do name them.' Would you inform Him of what He does not know in the earth? Or, is it a mere empty saying? Nay, but the design of the disbelievers has been made to appear beautiful in their eyes, and they have been kept back from the right way. And he whom God lets go astray shall have no guide.",
  "en_tr_asad": "IS, THEN, HE who has every living being in His almighty care, [dealing with each] according to what it deserves &ndash; [is, then, He like anything else that exists]? And yet, they ascribe to other beings a share in God's divinity!\nSay: \"Give them any name [you please]: but do you [really think that you could] inform Him of anything on earth that He does not know &ndash; or [do you] but play with words?\"\nNay, goodly seems their false imagery to those who are bent on denying the truth, and so they are turned away from the [right] path: and he whom God lets go astray can never find any guide.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "What, He who stands over every soul for what it has earned? -- And yet they ascribe to God associates. Say: Name them! Or will you tell Him what He knows not in the earth? Or in apparent words? Nay; but decked out fair to the unbelievers is their devising, and they are barred from the way; and whomsoever God leads astray, no guide has he.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Is it, then, in regard to Him Who watches over the deeds of every person{{50}},{{51}} that they are acting blasphemously by setting up His associates? Tell them: \"Name those associates (if Allah Himself has made them His associates)! Or are you informing Allah of something the existence of which He does not even know?\" Or do people arbitrarily utter empty words?{{52}} Indeed, their foul contriving{{53}} has been made to seem fair to the unbelievers and they have been barred from finding the Right Way.{{54}} Whomsoever Allah lets go astray will have none to guide him.",
