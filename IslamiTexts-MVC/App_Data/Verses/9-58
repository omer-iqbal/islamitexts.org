There is a vast body of literature on this subject. The main points may be studied in Al Hidaya fil Furu, of Shaikh Burhanud-din 'Ali.

This comprises everything that a believer freely gives to another person, out of love or compassion, as well as what he is morally or legally obliged to give, without expecting any worldly return: that is, charitable gifts and deeds of every description (which is the primary meaning of sadagdt - e.g., in 2:263 and 264), as well as the obligatory tax called zakah (\"the purifying dues\", because its payment purifies, as it were, a person's property from the taint of selfishness). In the context of the above verse, this term refers to the funds thus collected and administered by the Muslim community or state. When these funds are disbursed for the purposes stipulated in verse 60, they assume once more - this time in relation to the recipients - the aspect of \"charitable gifts\"."
