  "en_tr_yusuf": "Do the (ungodly) wait until the angels come to them, or there comes the Command of thy Lord (for their doom)? So did those who went before them. But Allah wronged them not: nay, they wronged their own souls.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Await they aught say that the angels should come unto them or thy Lord's command should come to pass? Even so did those before them. Allah wronged them not, but they did wrong themselves,",

  "en_tr_asad": "ARE THEY [who deny the truth] but waiting for the angels to appear unto them, or for your Sustainer's judgment to become manifest?\nEven thus did behave those [stubborn sinners] who lived before their time; and [when they were destroyed,] it was not God who wronged them, but it was they who had wronged themselves:",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Do they look for aught but that the angels shall come to them, or thy Lords command shall come? So did those before them, and God wronged them not, but themselves they wronged.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "(O Muhammad), are they waiting for anything else than that the angels should appear before them, or that your Lord's judgement should come?{{29}} Many before them acted with similar temerity.
