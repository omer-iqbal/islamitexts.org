But \"plain\" may mean unadorned, the opposite of beautiful, and this Book is among the most beautiful that it is the privilege of mankind to read. \"Clear\" would be right as far as it means \"unambiguous, self-evident, not involved in mysteries of origin, history, or meaning, one which everyone can understand as to the essentials necessary for him, without the intervention of priests or privileged persons\". Mubin has all these meanings, but it suggests, besides, some quality of a shining light, by which we are able to make things clear, to distinguish the true from the false. This I think is suggested better by \"perspicuous\" than by the word \"clear\". Besides it is hardly good idiom to speak of \"a clear Book\", (Cf. 7:183 and 12:1)."

There is of course, no doubt that in its transitive form the verb also denotes \"he concealed [something]\". i.e., from others: but in view of the preceding phrase, \"there has come unto you Our Apostle to make clear unto you\", it is obvious that what is alluded to in this context is the concealing of something from oneself: in other words, it is a reference to the gradual obscuring, by the followers of the Bible, of its original verities which they are now unwilling to admit even to themselves."
