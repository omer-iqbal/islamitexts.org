However, taking into account the primary meaning of musstagarr as \"the limit of a course\" - i.e., the point at which a thing reaches its fulfilment or end - and of mustawda' as \"a place of consignment\" or \"repository\", we arrive at the rendering adopted by me above. This rendering finds, moreover, strong support in 11:6, where God is spoken of as providing sustenance for every living being and knowing \"its time-limit [on earth] and its resting-place [after death]\" (mustagarraha wa-mustawda'aha), as well as in verse 67 of the present surah, where mustaqarr is used in the sense of \"a term set for the fulfilment [of God's tiding]\"."
