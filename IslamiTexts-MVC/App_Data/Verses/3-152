  "en_tr_yusuf": "Allah did indeed fulfil His promise to you when ye with His permission Were about to annihilate your enemy,-until ye flinched and fell to disputing about the order, and disobeyed it after He brought you in sight (of the booty) which ye covet.

  "en_tr_qarib": "Allah has been true in His promise towards you when you routed them by His leave, until you lost heart, and quarreled about the matter, and disobeyed, afterHe had shown you that which you loved.

  "en_tr_sher": "And God had surely made good to you His promise when you were slaying and destroying them by His leave, until, when your courage failed you and you disputed among yourselves concerning the order and you disobeyed, after He had shown you that which you love, He withdrew His help.

Then He turned you away from them, that He might try you -- and He has surely pardoned you, and God is Gracious to the believers -",

But now He has effaced your sin: for God is limitless in His bounty unto the believers.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "God has been true in His promise towards you when you blasted them by His leave; until you lost heart, and quarrelled about the matter, and were rebellious, after He had shown you that you longed for.

  "en_tr_maududi": "Allah surely fulfilled His promise (of succour) when you were slaying them by His leave until the moment when you flagged and quarrelled among yourselves about the matter, and acted against the order of (the Prophet).
