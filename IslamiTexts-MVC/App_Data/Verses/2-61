  "en_tr_yusuf": "And remember ye said: \"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its pot-herbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions.\" He said: \"Will ye exchange the better for the worse? Go ye down to any town, and ye shall find what ye want!\" They were covered with humiliation and misery; they drew on themselves the wrath of Allah. This because they went on rejecting the Signs of Allah and slaying His Messengers without just cause. This because they rebelled and went on transgressing.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And when ye said: O Moses! We are weary of one kind of food; so call upon thy Lord for us that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth - of its herbs and its cucumbers and its corn and its lentils and its onions. He said: Would ye exchange that which is higher for that which is lower? Go down to settled country, thus ye shall get that which ye demand. And humiliation and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they were visited with wrath from Allah. That was because they disbelieved in Allah's revelations and slew the prophets wrongfully. That was for their disobedience and transgression.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And when you said: O Musa! we cannot bear with one food, therefore pray Lord on our behalf to bring forth for us out of what the earth grows, of its herbs and its cucumbers and its garlic and its lentils and its onions. He said: Will you exchange that which is better for that which is worse? Enter a city, so you will have what you ask for. And abasement and humiliation were brought down upon them, and they became deserving of Allah's wrath; this was so because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and killed the prophets unjustly; this was so because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And (remember) when you said, \"O Musa (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs, its cucumbers, its Fum (wheat or garlic), its lentils and its onions.\" He said, \"Would you exchange that which is better for that which is lower? Go you down to any town and you shall find what you want!\" And they were covered with humiliation and misery, and they drew on themselves the Wrath of Allah. That was because they used to disbelieve the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah and killed the Prophets wrongfully. That was because they disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds (in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit crimes and sins).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And recall what time ye said: O Musa! we shall by no means bear patiently with one food, wherefore supplicate for us unto thy Lord that He bring forth for us of that which the earth groweth, of its vegetables, and its cucumbers, and its Wheat, and its lentils, and its onions. He Said: would ye take in exchange that which is mean for that which is better! Get ye down into a City, as verily therein is for you that which ye ask for. And stuck upon them were abjection and poverty. And they drew on themselves indignation from Allah. This, because they were ever disbelieving in the signs of Allah and slaying the prophets without justice. This, because they disobeyed and were ever trespassing.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "'Moses, ' you said, 'we will no longer be patient with one type of food. Call on your Lord to bring forth for us some of the produce of the earth, green herbs and cucumbers, corn, lentils and onions. ' 'What! ' he answered, 'Would you exchange that which is lesser for what is better? Go down into Egypt, there you shall find all that you have asked. ' Humiliation and abasement were pitched upon them, and they incurred the Anger of Allah; because they disbelieved His signs and slew His Prophets unjustly; because they disobeyed and were transgressors.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And (remember) when you said, `O Moses, we will not endure only one food; pray to thy Lord for us that He may bring forth for us, of that which the earth produces ___ of its herbs, its cucumbers, its corn, its lentils and its onions.' He said, `do you ask in exchange that which is inferior for that which is better? Get you down to a city and you shall have what you demand.' And they were struck with abasement and misery, and they were laden with God's wrath; that because they disbelieved in the signs of God and killed the Prophets without right; that because they disobeyed and were exceeding limits.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And remember when you said, O Moses, surely we will not remain content with one kind of food; pray, then, to thy Lord for us that He may bring forth for us of what the earth grows -- of its herbs and its cucumbers and its wheat and its lentils and its onions.' He said, 'Would you take in exchange that which is worse for that which is better? Go down to some town and there is for you what you ask.' And they were smitten with abasement and destitution, and they incurred the wrath of God; that was because they rejected the Signs of God and sought to slay the Prophets unjustly; this was because they rebelled and transgressed.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And [remember] when you said: \"O Moses, indeed we cannot endure but one kind of food; pray, then, to thy Sustainer that He bring forth for us aught of what grows from the earth &ndash; of its herbs, its cucumbers, its garlic, its lentils, its onions.\" \nSaid [Moses]: \"Would you take a lesser thing in exchange for what is [so much] better? Go back in shame to Egypt, and then you can have what you are asking for!\"\nAnd so, ignominy and humiliation overshadowed them, and they earned the burden of God's condemnation: all this, because they persisted in denying the truth of God's messages and in slaying the prophets against all right: all this, because they rebelled [against God], and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And when you said, Moses, we will not endure one sort of food; pray to thy Lord for us, that He may bring forth for us of that the earth produces - green herbs, cucumbers, corn, lentils, onions. He said, Would you have in exchange what is meaner for what is better? Get you down to Egypt; you shall have there that you demanded. And abasement and poverty were pitched upon them, and they were laden with the burden of Gods anger; that, because they had disbelieved the signs of God and slain the Prophets unrightfully; that, because they disobeyed, and were transgressors",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Remember: You grumbled: \"O Moses, we cannot endure one and the same sort of food. Pray your Lord to bring for us the products of the earth green herbs, vegetables, corn, garlic, onions, pulses and the like.\" Moses replied: \"What! would you exchange that which is meaner for that which is nobler?{{77}} Well, go and live in a town and you will get there what you demand.\" By and by, they became so degraded that disgrace and humiliation, misery and wretchedness were stamped upon them and they incurred Allah's wrath. That was because they began to reject the Revelations of Allah{{78}} and kill His Messengers without any just cause;{{79}} that was the consequence of their disobedience and their persistent transgression against the Law.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "And remember ye said: \"O Moses! we cannot endure one kind of food (always); so beseech thy Lord for us to produce for us of what the earth groweth, -its potherbs, and cucumbers, Its garlic, lentils, and onions.\" He said: \"Will ye exchange the better for the worse?

The Tanwin expressing indefiniteness may mean \"any Egypt\", i.e., any country as fertile as Egypt. There is here a subtle reminiscence as well as a severe reproach. The rebellious children of Israel murmured at the sameness of the food they got in the desert. They were evidently hankering after the delicacies of the Egypt which they had left, although they should have known that the only thing certain for them in Egypt was their bondage and harsh treatment. Moses's reproach to them was twofold: (1) Such variety of foods you can get in any town: would you, for their sake, sell your freedom? Is not freedom better than delicate food? (2) In front of the rich Promised Land, which you are reluctant to march to; behind is Egypt, the land of bondage. Which is better? Would you exchange the better for the worse?"

They were carried in captivity to Assyria. They were restored under the Persians, bus still remained under the Persian yoke, and they were under the yoke of the Greeks, the Romans, and Arabs. They were scattered all over the earth, and have been a wandering people ever since, because they rejected faith, slew Allah's messengers, and went on transgressing. The slaving of the Prophets begins with the murder of Abel, who was in the ancestry of Israel. The elder sons of Jacob attempted the murder of Joseph when they dropped him into the well, and if he was afterwards rescued by strangers, their blood-guilt was none the less. In later history they attempted to slay Jesus, in as much as they got the Roman Governor to crucify one in his likeness, and they attempted to take the life of Mustafa. But the moral goes wider than the Children of Israel. It applies to all nations and all individuals. If they are stiff-necked, if they set a greater value on perishable goods than on freedom and eternal salvation, if they break the law of Allah and resist His grace, their portion must be humiliation and misery in the spiritual world and probably even on this earth if a long view is taken."
