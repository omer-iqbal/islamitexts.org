      "note": "Lit., \"all pairs\". Some commentators regard the term azwaj as synonymous in this context with \"kinds\" (Baghawi, Zamakhsharl, Baydawi, Ibn Kathir): i.e., they take the above phrase to mean no more than that God created all kinds of things, beings and phenomena. Others (e.g., Tabari) see in it a reference to the polarity evident in all creation. Ibn 'Abbas (as quoted by Razi) says that it denotes the concept of opposites in general, like \"sweet and sour, or white and black, or male and female\"; to which Razi adds that everything in creation has its complement, \"like high and low, right and left, front and back, past and future, being and attribute\", etc., whereas God - and He alone - is unique, without anything that could be termed \"opposite\" or \"similar\" or \"complementary\". Hence, the above sentence is an echo of the statement that \"there is nothing that could be compared with Him\" (112:4)."
