What is an individual himself? What is his relation to the universal Laws of Allah? In outer nature we can see that there is no clear-cut line between night and day: each merges into the other. Yet the sun and the moon obey definite laws. Though they seem to go on forever. Yet their existence and duration themselves are but an atom in Allah's great universe. How much more \"merging\" and imperceptible gradation there is in the inner and spiritual world? Our actions themselves cannot be classified and ticketed and labelled when examined in relation to motives and circumstances. Yet they are like an open book before Allah."
