If spiritual enlightenment goes so far as to take a man beyond his ancestral worship, people will come to dispute with him. They will frighten him with the dire consequences of his dissent.

On the contrary, he knows that it is the godless who have just grounds for fear. And he offers admonition to them, and arguments that should bring them the clearness of truth instead of the vagueness and mystery of superstition-the security of Faith instead of the haunting fear of those who have no clear guidance.
