Just as verses 15-16 are meant to draw our attention to the sin of tribal or racial prejudice (see note 15), the present reference to Pharaoh as an \"archetype [of evil]\" points to the fact that false pride (takabbur) and arrogance (istikbar) are truly \"satanic\" attitudes of mind, repeatedly exemplified in the Qur'an by Iblis's symbolic \"revolt\" against God (for the meaning of which see note 26 on 2:34 and note 31 on 15:41). Inasmuch as they are intrinsically evil, these \"satanic\" impulses lead to evil actions and, consequently, to aweakening or even a total destruction of man's spiritual potential: which, in its turn, is bound to cause suffering in the hereafter."
