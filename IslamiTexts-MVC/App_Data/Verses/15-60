As I have repeatedly pointed out in my notes, God's \"ordaining\" a sinner to commit a sin or His \"decreeing\" that he should remain deaf to the voice of truth is a metonym for the natural law instituted by Him, which has been explained in surah 2, note 7; it refers also, generally speaking, to God's absolute fore-knowledge of how any of His creatures will act in a given situation (Zamakhshari). See also note 56 on 11:34 and note 4 on 14:4."
