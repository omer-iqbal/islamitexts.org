The Jews had taken much to sorcery, magic, divination, and such superstitions, (Cf. 16:51)."

It denotes, according to some authorities, \"something which is worthless in itself or \"something in which there is no good\" (Qamus, Baydawi); according to others, it signifies \"enchantment\" (Umar ibn al-Khattab, Mujahid and Sha'bi as quoted by Tabari; also Qamus); others, again, interpret it as \"anything that is worshipped instead of God\" (Zamakhshari), and consequently apply it also to idols and idol-worship (Qamus, Lisan al-'Arab) and - according to a Tradition quoted by Abu Da'ud - to all manner of superstitious divination and soothsaying as well. Taking all these interpretations into account, al-jibt may be defined as \"a combination of confusing ideas (dijl), fanciful surmises (awham) and fictitious stories (khurafat)\" (Manar V, 157) - in other words, abstruse mysteries without any foundation in fact. - As regards the expression \"the powers of evil\" (at-taghut), it seems to refer here to superstitious beliefs and practices - like soothsaying, foretelling the future, relying on \"good\" and \"bad\" omens, and so forth - all of which are condemned by the Qur'an. See also surah 2, verse 256."
