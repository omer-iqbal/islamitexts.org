  "en_tr_yusuf": "Among them is (many) a man who says: \"Grant me exemption and draw me not into trial.\" Have they not fallen into trial already? and indeed Hell surrounds the Unbelievers (on all sides).",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Of them is he who saith: Grant me leave (to stay at home) and tempt me not. Surely it is into temptation that they (thus) have fallen. Lo! hell verily is all around the disbelievers.",

      "note": "Fitnah, as explained in n. 1198, 8:25, may mean either trial or temptation, or else tumult, turmoil, or sedition. The Commentators here take the former meaning, and explain that some Hypocrites claimed exemption from service in the Tabuk expedition in the direction of Syria on the plea that they could not withstand the charms of Syrian women and ought best to stay at home. The answer is: \"But you have already fallen into temptation here by refusing service and disobeying the call.\" But perhaps the other meaning of \"turmoil\" may also be permissible as a secondary echo: in that case they object to be drawn into the turmoil of war, but they are told that they are already in a moral turmoil in advancing a disingenuous plea. In using the English word \"trial\" in the translation, I have also had in my mind the two shades of meaning associated with that word in English."

It is to be noted that both the verbal form la taftinni (rendered by me as \"do not put me to too hard a test\") and the noun fitnah have the same root, comprising a great complex of meanings: e.g., test, trial, affliction, temptation to evil, seduction, persecution, oppression, discord, civil strife, etc. (cf. surah 8, note 25). Since it is impossible in any language but Arabic to reproduce all these many shades of meaning in a single expression, the rendering of the term fitnah must necessarily vary in accordance with the context in which it is used."
