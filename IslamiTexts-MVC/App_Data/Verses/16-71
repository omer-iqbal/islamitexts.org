  "en_tr_yusuf": "Allah has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others: those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so as to be equal in that respect. Will they then deny the favours of Allah?",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And Allah hath favoured some of you above others in provision. Now those who are more favoured will by no means hand over their provision to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof. Is it then the grace of Allah that they deny?",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And Allah has made some of you excel others in the means of subsistence, so those who are made to excel do not give away their sustenance to those whom their right hands possess so that they should be equal therein; is it then the favor of Allah which they deny?",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And Allah has preferred some of you above others in wealth and properties. Then, those who are preferred will by no means hand over their wealth and properties to those (slaves) whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal with them in respect thereof. Do they then deny the Favour of Allah?",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And Allah hath preferred some of you over some other in provision; then those who are preferred are not going to hand over their provision to those whom their right hands possess as to be equal in respect thereof. Gainsay they then the favour of Allah?",
  "en_tr_qarib": "In your provisions Allah has preferred some of you above others. But, those who have been preferred do not give their provisions to those whom their right hand possess so that they might be equal therein. What, do they vainly disbelieve the favor of Allah?",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And God has made some of you to excel others in provision; then those who are made to excel, do not give over their provision to those whom their right hands own, so that they may become equal in it; will they then deny the blessing of God?",
  "en_tr_sher": "And God has favoured some of you above others in worldly gifts. But those more favoured will not restore any part of their worldly gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so that they may be equal shares in them. Knowing this, will they still deny the favour of God?",
  "en_tr_asad": "And on some of you God has bestowed more abundant means of sustenance than on others: and yet, they who are more abundantly favoured are [often] unwilling to share their sustenance with those whom their right hands possess, so that they [all] might be equal in this respect. Will they, then, God's blessings [thus] deny?",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And God has preferred some of you over others in provision;, but those that were preferred shall not give over their provision to that their right hands possess, so that they may be equal therein. What, and do they deny Gods blessing?",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Allah has favoured some of you with more worldly provisions than others. Then those who are more favoured do not give away their provisions to their slaves lest they become equal sharers in it. Do they, then, deny the favour of Allah?{{62}}",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Allah has bestowed His gifts of sustenance more freely on some of you than on others: those more favoured are not going to throw back their gifts to those whom their right hands possess, so as to be equal in that respect. Will they then deny the favours of Allah?{{2102}}",

      "note": "The phrase \"to share their sustenance with ...\", etc., reads, literally, \"to turn over their sustenance to\". The expression \"those whom their right hands possess\" (i.e., \"those whom they rightfully possess\") may relate either to slaves taken captive in a war in God's cause (see surah 2, notes 167 and 168, and surah 8, note 72) or, metonymically, to all who are dependent on others for their livelihood and thus become the latters' responsibility. The placing of one's dependants on an equal footing with oneself with regard to the basic necessities of life is a categorical demand of Islam; thus, the Prophet said: \"They are your brethren, these dependants of yours (khawalukum) whom God has placed under your authority [lit., \"under your hand\"]. Hence, whoso has his brother under his authority shall give him to eat of what he eats himself, and shall clothe him with what he clothes himself. And do not burden them with anything that may be beyond their strength; but if you [must] burden them, help them yourselves.\" (This authentic Tradition, recorded by Bukhari in several variants in his Sahih, appears in the compilations of Muslim, Tirmidhi and Ibn Hanbal as well.) However, men often fail to live up to this consciousness of moral responsibility: and this failure amounts, as the sequence shows, to a denial of God's blessings and of His unceasing care for all His creatures."
