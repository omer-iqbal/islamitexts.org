  "en_tr_yusuf": "And when they entered in the manner their father had enjoined, it did not profit them in the least against (the plan of) Allah: It was but a necessity of Jacob's soul, which he discharged. For he was, by our instruction, full of knowledge (and experience): but most men know not.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And when they entered in the manner which their father had enjoined, it would have naught availed them as against Allah; it was but a need of Jacob's soul which he thus satisfied; and lo! he was a lord of knowledge because We had taught him; but most of mankind know not.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And when they had entered as their father had bidden them, it did not avail them aught against Allah, but (it was only) a desire in the soul of Yaqoub which he satisfied; and surely he was possessed of knowledge because We had given him knowledge, but most people do not know.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And when they entered according to their father's advice, it did not avail them in the least against (the Will of) Allah, it was but a need of Ya'qub's (Jacob) inner-self which he discharged. And verily, he was endowed with knowledge because We had taught him, but most men know not.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And when they entered as their father had enjoined them, it availed them not against Allah at all; it was only a craving in the soul of Ya qub that he satisfied; verily he was endued with knowledge, for We had taught him; but most of the people know not.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "And when they entered from where their father had instructed them, nothing helped them against (the decree of) Allah. It was but a need in Jacob's soul which he had fulfilled. He possessed knowledge because of what We had taught him, though most people do not know.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And when they entered wherefrom their father had enjoined them, it availed them not against Cod in the least, except that it was a craving in Jacob's soul which he satisfied And he was surely a man of knowledge as We had taught him, but most men have no knowledge.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And when they entered in the manner their father had commanded them, Jacob's purpose was fulfilled but it could not avail them anything against God, except that there was a desire in Jacob's mind which he thus satisfied; and he was surely possessed of great knowledge We had taught him, but most men know not.",
  "en_tr_asad": "But although they entered [Joseph's city] in the way their father had bidden them, this proved of no avail whatever to them against [the plan of] God. [His request] had served only to satisfy Jacob's heartfelt desire [to protect them]: for, behold, thanks to what We had imparted unto him, he was indeed endowed with the knowledge [that God's will must always prevail]; but most people know it not.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And when they entered after the manner their father commanded them, it availed them nothing against God; but it was a need in Jacobs soul that he so satisfied. Verily he was possessed of a knowledge for that We had taught him; but most men know not.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And it so happened that when they entered the city (by many gates) as their father had directed them, this precautionary measure proved ineffective against Allah's will. There was an uneasiness in Jacob's soul which he so tried to remove. Surely he was possessed of knowledge owing to the knowledge that We bestowed upon him. But most people do not know the truth of the matter.{{54}}",

This, Jacob did to his unworthy sons, as well as to his worthy sons whom he loved best. It was not for him as a Prophet to guarantee any results. In this case he could not save his Sons from getting into trouble merely because they followed the letter of his advice in a small matter. Apply this to the teaching of one who is greater than Jacob. Men who literally observe some small injunctions of the Holy Prophet Muhammad and neglect the greater principles which he taught cannot blame him for their troubles and difficulties. If they examined the matter, they would find that they brought the troubles on themselves."
