Razi, in particular, points in this context to surah 14, verse 22, according to which Satan will thus address the sinners on Resurrection Day: \"I had no power at all over you: I but called you - and you responded to me. Hence, blame not me, but blame yourselves.\" See also note 31 on 14:22, in which Razi's comment is quoted verbatim."
