  "en_tr_yusuf": "Further he said: \"O my sons! enter not all by one gate: enter ye by different gates. Not that I can profit you aught against Allah (with my advice): None can command except Allah: On Him do I put my trust: and let all that trust put their trust on Him.\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And he said: O my sons! Go not in by one gate; go in by different gates. I can naught avail you as against Allah. Lo! the decision rests with Allah only. In Him do I put my trust, and in Him let all the trusting put their trust.",

  "en_tr_ayubk": "And he said, `O my sons, do not enter by the same gate, but enter by different gates; yet I cannot avail you against God in the least; judgement belongs only to God; in Him I put my trust and in Him let the trustful put their trust.'",
  "en_tr_sher": "And he said, 'O my sons, enter not by one gate, but enter by different gates, and I can avail you naught against God. The decision rest only with God. In Him do I put my trust and in Him let all who would trust put their trust.'",
  "en_tr_asad": "And he added: \"O my sons! Do not enter [the city all] by one gate, but enter by different gates. Yet [even so,] I can be of no avail whatever to you against [anything that may be willed by] God: judgment [as to what is to happen] rests with none but God. In Him have I placed my trust: for all who have trust [in His existence] must place their trust in Him alone.\"",
  "en_tr_arberry": "He also said, O my sons, enter not by one door; enter by separate doors. Yet I cannot avail you anything against God; judgment belongs not to any but God. In Him I have put my trust; and in Him let all put their trust who put their trust.",

      "note": "The Commentators refer to a Jewish (or Eastern) custom (or superstition) which forbade members of a numerous family to go together in a mass for fear of \"the evil eye\". But apart from East or West, or custom or superstition, it would be ridiculous for any large family of ten or eleven to parade together in a procession among strangers. But there was even a better reason in this particular case, which made Jacob's advice sound, and Jacob was, as stated in the next verse, a man of knowledge and experience. Here were eleven strangers dressed alike, in a dress not of the country, talking a strange language, coming in a time of stress, on an errand for which they had no credentials. Would they not attract undue attention and suspicion if they went together? Would they not be taken for spies??or for men bent on some mischief, theft, or organised crime? Such a suspicion is referred to in verse 73 below. By entering separately they would attract little attention. Jacob very wisely tells them to take all human precautions. But like a Prophet of Allah he warns them that human precautions would be no good if they neglect or run counter to far weightier matters?Allah's Will and Law. Above all, they must try to understand and obey this, and their trust should be on Allah rather than on human usages, institutions, or precautions, however, good and reasonable these might be (Cf. 39:58).
