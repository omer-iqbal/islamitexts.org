  "ar_text": "وَيَوْمَ يَحْشُرُهُمْ كَأَنْ لَمْ يَلْبَثُوا إِلَّا سَاعَةً مِنَ النَّهَارِ يَتَعَارَفُونَ بَيْنَهُمْ قَدْ خَسِرَ الَّذِينَ كَذَّبُوا بِلِقَاءِ اللَّهِ وَمَا كَانُوا مُهْتَدِينَ",
  "ar_text_clean": "ويوم يحشرهم كأن لم يلبثوا إلا ساعة من النهار يتعارفون بينهم قد خسر الذين كذبوا بلقاء الله وما كانوا مهتدين",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "One day He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried but an hour of a day: they will recognise each other: assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And on the day when He shall gather them together, (when it will seem) as though they had tarried but an hour of the day, recognising one another, those will verily have perished who denied the meeting with Allah and were not guided.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And on the day when He will gather them as though they had not stayed but an hour of the day, they will know each other. They will perish indeed who called the meeting with Allah to be a lie, and they are not followers of the right direction.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And on the Day when He shall gather (resurrect) them together, (it will be) as if they had not stayed (in the life of this world and graves, etc.) but an hour of a day. They will recognise each other. Ruined indeed will be those who denied the meeting with Allah, and were not guided.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And of the Day whereon He shall gather them, as though they had tarried not save an hour of he day they shall mutually recognize. Lost surely are those who belie the meeting with Allah and they were not such as to be guided.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "The Day when He will gather them, (it will be) as though they had lingered but an hour of the Day and they will recognize one another. Lost are those who belied the meeting with their Lord and were not guided.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And the day He shall muster them, it will be as if they did not stay (in the world) but an hour of the day, and they will recognise one another; They are indeed losers who give lies to the meeting with God and were not guided.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And on the day when He will gather them together, it will appear to them as though they had not tarried in the world save for an hour of a day. They will recognize one another. Losers indeed are those who deny the meeting with God and would not follow guidance.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And on the Day when He shall gather them [unto Himself, it will seem to them] as if they had not tarried [on earth] longer than an hour of a day, knowing one another; [and] lost indeed will be they who [in their lifetime] considered it a lie that they were destined to meet God and [thus] failed to find the right way.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And the day He shall muster them, as if they had not tarried but an hour of the day, mutually recognizing one another; lost will be those who cried lies to the encounter with God, and were not guided.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "(But today they are oblivious of everything except enjoyment of worldly life.) And on the Day when He will muster all men together, they will feel as though they had been in the world no more than an hour of the day to get acquainted with one another.{{53}} (It will then become evident that) those who called the lie to meeting with Allah{{54}} were utter losers and were not rightly-directed. underlies this sharp remark is the faint hope that perhaps such people would be shaken out of their slumber.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "One day He will gather them together: (It will be) as if they had tarried{{1436}} but an hour of a day: they will recognise each other:{{1437}} assuredly those will be lost who denied the meeting with Allah and refused to receive true guidance.",
  "en_ctr_asad": "And on the Day when He shall gather them [unto Himself, it will seem to them] as if they had not tarried [on earth] longer than an hour of a day, knowing one another;{{65}} [and] lost indeed will be they who [in their lifetime] considered it a lie that they were destined to meet God, and [thus] failed to find the right way.",
