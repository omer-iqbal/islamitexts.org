      "note": "This allegorical expression, used here with reference to Mary's conception of Jesus, has been widely - and erroneously - interpreted as relating specifically to his birth. As a matter of fact, the Qur'an uses the same expression in three other places with reference to the creation of man in general - namely in 15:29 and 38:72, \"when I have formed him ... and breathed into him of My spirit\"; and in 32:9, \"and thereupon He forms [lit., \"formed\"] him fully and breathes lit., \"breathed\"] into him of His spirit\". In particular, the passage of which the last-quoted phrase is a part (i.e., 32:7-9) makes it abundantly and explicitly clear that God \"breathes of His spirit\" into every human being. Commenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhshari states that \"the breathing of the spirit [of God] into a body signifies the endowing it with life\": an explanation with which Razi concurs. (In this connection, see also note 181 on 4:171.) As for the description of Mary as allati ahsanat farjaha; idiomatically denoting \"one who guarded her chastity\" (lit., \"her private parts\"), it is to be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \"[one's] being fortified [against any danger or evil]\" - has the tropical meaning of \"abstinence from what is unlawful or reprehensible\" (Taj al-'Arus), and especially from illicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man as well as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan and muhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur'an to describe, respectively, a man or a woman who is \"fortified [by marriage] against unchastity\". Hence, the expression allati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse as well as in 66:12 with reference to Mary, is but meant to stress her outstanding chastity and complete abstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anything unlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, a rejection of the calumny (referred to in 4:156 and obliquely alluded to in 19:27-28) that the birth of Jesus was the result of an \"illicit union\"."
