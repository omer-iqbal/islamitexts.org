The reply is: (1) that even everyone who is good does not necessarily know what is best for him, for the values in this life are curiously distorted; and (2) on account of their want of knowledge, if everyone got all he asked for, there would be chaos and confusion, and \"transgression beyond bounds through the earth\", for the different interests are so intermingled and balanced that some measure must be observed in granting people's wishes.

      "note": "This passage connects with, and elucidates, the statement in the preceding verse that God \"responds unto all who attain to faith and do righteous deeds\" - a statement which, at first glance, seems to be contrary to the fact that whereas many wrongdoers prosper and are happy, many righteous people suffer hurt and deprivation. In reply to this objection, the above verse points elliptically to man's innate \"greed for mere and more\" (see 102:1), which often causes him to become \"grossly overweening whenever he believes himself to be self-sufficient\" (96:6). To counteract this tendency, the Qur'an stresses again and again that God's \"response\" to the righteous - as well as to wrongdoers - will become fully evident only in the life to come, and not necessarily in this world, which, after all, is only the first, short stage of man's existence."
