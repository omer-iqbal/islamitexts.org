      "note": "Great News; usually understood to mean the News or Message of the Resurrection or the Hereafter, about which there are various schools of thought among the Jews and Christians and other nations. There is practically nothing about the Resurrection in the Old Testament, and the Jewish sect of Sadducees even in the time of Christ denied the Resurrection altogether. The Pagan ideas of a future life-if any-varied from place to place and from time to time. Even in the early Christian Church, as we learn from Paul's First Epistle to the Corinthians, there were contentions in that little community (I. Corinthians, 1:11), and some definitely denied the resurrection of the dead (ib., 15:12).<br/>Great News may also be translated Great Message or a Message Supreme as I have translated at 38:67. In that case it would refer to the Qur'an, or the Message of Revelation, or the Message of the Prophet, about which there was great contention in those days. As this Message also lays great stress on the Day of Judgement and the Resurrection, the practical result by either mode of interpretation amounts to the same."
