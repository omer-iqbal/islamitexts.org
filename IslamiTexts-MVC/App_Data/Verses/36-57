      "note": "Thirdly, besides any external conditions of Bliss, the Bliss in the Hereafter has an inner quality, expressed by the word fakihatun. The root fakikah means 'to rejoice greatly', to be full of merriment'. The ordinary meaning of 'fruit' attached to fakihah is derived from the idea that the flavour of choice, ripe fruit, delights the heart of man (Cf. n. 4062). Just as akala (to eat) is used for 'enjoyment', (5:66, n. 776 and 13:35, n. 1854), so fakihah, 'fruit', stands here for that specially choice enjoyment, which goes with a fastidious and well-cultivated taste. In other words, it suggests that highest kind of joy which depends upon the inner faculty rather than any outward circumstance. This is further emphasised by the second clause: \"they shall have whatever they call for\". Again using the language of this life, the musician's heaven will be full of music; the mathematician's will be full of mathematical symmetry and perfection; the artist's will be full of beauty of form, and so on."
