  "en_tr_yusuf": "Allah sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place: Yet was it ungrateful for the favours of Allah: so Allah made it taste of hunger and terror (in extremes) (closing in on it) like a garment (from every side), because of the (evil) which (its people) wrought.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Allah coineth a similitude: a township that dwelt secure and well content, its provision coming to it in abundance from every side, but it disbelieved in Allah's favours, so Allah made it experience the garb of dearth and fear because of what they used to do.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And Allah sets forth a parable: (Consider) a town safe and secure to which its means of subsistence come in abundance from every quarter; but it became ungrateful to Allah's favors, therefore Allah made it to taste the utmost degree of hunger and fear because of what they wrought.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And Allah puts forward the example of a township (Makkah), that dwelt secure and well content; its provision coming to it in abundance from every place, but it (its people) denied the Favours of Allah (with ungratefulness). So Allah made it taste the extreme of hunger (famine) and fear, because of that (evil, i.e. denying Prophet Muhammad SAW) which they (its people) used to do.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And Allah propoundeth a similitude: a town which was secure and at rest, to which came the provision thereof plenteously from every place; then it ungratefully denied the favours of Allah; wherefore Allah made it taste the extreme of hunger and fear because of that which they were wont to perform.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Allah strikes a parable of the village which was safe and peaceful. Its provisions came in abundance from everywhere; but it was thankless for the favors of Allah. Therefore, for what they were doing, Allah let it taste the garment of hunger and fear.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And God strikes a similitude: a city that was secure and content, its provision coming to it easefully from every place; then it became unthankful to the blessings of God; so God let it taste overwhelming hunger and fear for the things that they were working.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And God sets forth the parable of a city which enjoyed security and peace; its provisions come to it in plenty from every quarter; but it was ungrateful for the favours of God, so God made it taste hunger and fear which clothed it like a garment because of what they used do.",
  "en_tr_asad": "AND GOD propounds [to you] a parable: [Imagine] a town which was [once] secure and at ease, with its sustenance coming to it abundantly from all quarters, and which thereupon blasphemously refused to show gratitude for God's blessings: and therefore God caused it to taste the all-embracing misery of hunger and fear in result of all [the evil] that its people had so persistently wrought.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "God has struck a similitude: a city that was secure, at rest, its provision coming to it easefully from every place, then it was unthankful for the blessings of God; so God let it taste the garment of hunger and of fear, for the things that they were working.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Allah sets forth the parable of (the people of) a town who were secure and content and whose sustenance came in abundance from every quarter. But then the people of the town showed ingratitude towards Allah for His bounties, so Allah afflicted them with hunger and fear in punishment for their evil deeds.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Allah sets forth a Parable: a city enjoying security{{2149}} and quiet, abundantly supplied with sustenance from every place: Yet was it ungrateful for the favours of Allah. so Allah made it taste of hunger and terror (in extremes) (closing in on it) like a garment{{2150}} (from every side), because of the (evil) which (its people) wrought.",
