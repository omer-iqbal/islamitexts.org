In our daily life, what would happen if we woke up some fine morning to find that the sources and springs of our water supply had disappeared and gone down into the hollows of the earth? Nothing could save our life. Without water we cannot live, and water cannot rise above its level, but always seeks a lower level. So in spiritual life. Its sources and springs are in the divine wisdom that flows from on high. Allah is the real source of that life, as He is of all forms of life. We must seek His Grace and Mercy. We cannot find grace or mercy or blessing from anything lower. His Wisdom and Mercy are like fresh clear-flowing spring water, not like the muddy murky wisdom and goodness of this lower world which is only relative, and which often hampers life rather than advances it."
