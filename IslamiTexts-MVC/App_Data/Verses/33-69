      "note": "The people of Moses often vexed him and rebelled against him and against Allah's Law. Here the reference seems to be to Num. 12:1-15. It is there said that Moses's own sister Miriam and his brother Aaron spoke against Moses because Moses had married an Ethiopian woman. Allah cleared Moses of the charge of having done anything wrong: \"My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.\" Miriam was afflicted with leprosy for seven days as a punishment, after which she was forgiven, as also was Aaron. This is the Old Testament story. The Prophet was also attacked because of his marriage with Zaynab bintjahsh, but not by his own circle; his motives were of the highest and were completely vindicated as we have seen above."

These instances are paralleled here with the frequently cited accusations that Muhammad had \"invented\" the Qur'an and then falsely attributed it to God, that he was a madman, and so forth, as well as with frivolous demands to prove his prophethood by bringing about miracles or - as is restated in verse 63 of this surah - by predicting the date of the Last Hour."
