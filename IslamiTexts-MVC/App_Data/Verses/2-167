  "en_tr_yusuf": "And those who followed would say: \"If only We had one more chance, We would clear ourselves of them, as they have cleared themselves of us.\" Thus will Allah show them (The fruits of) their deeds as (nothing but) regrets. Nor will there be a way for them out of the Fire.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And those who were but followers will say: If a return were possible for us, we would disown them even as they have disowned us. Thus will Allah show them their own deeds as anguish for them, and they will not emerge from the Fire.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And those who followed shall say: Had there been for us a return, then we would renounce them as they have renounced us. Thus will Allah show them their deeds to be intense regret to them, and they shall not come forth from the fire.",

And they will never get out of the Fire.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And those who had followed shall say would that for us were a return, then would we quit ourselves of them as they have quitted themselves of us. In this wise Allah will show them their works as vain regrets; and they shall not be coming forth from the Fire.",

  "en_tr_asad": "And then those followers shall say: \"Would that we had a second chance [in life], so that we could disown them as they have disowned us!\" \nThus will God show them their works [in a manner that will cause them] bitter regrets; but they will not come out of the fire.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "and those that followed say, O if only we might return again and disown them, as they have disowned us! Even so God shall show them their works. O bitter regrets for them! Never shall they issue from the Fire.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Then those who followed them will say, \"Would that we were given another chance to return to the world: then we will disown them just as they have disowned us today.\"{{165}} Thus will Allah bring before them the deeds they did in the world in such a manner as to make them wring their hands in regret but they shall be unable to come out of the Fire.",
