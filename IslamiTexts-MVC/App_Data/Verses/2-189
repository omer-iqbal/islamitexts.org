  "en_tr_yusuf": "They ask thee concerning the New Moons. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage. It is no virtue if ye enter your houses from the back: It is virtue if ye fear Allah. Enter houses through the proper doors: And fear Allah: That ye may prosper.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "They ask thee, (O Muhammad), of new moons, say: They are fixed seasons for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not righteousness that ye go to houses by the backs thereof (as do the idolaters at certain seasons), but the righteous man is he who wardeth off (evil). So go to houses by the gates thereof, and observe your duty to Allah, that ye may be successful.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "They ask you concerning the new moon. Say: They are times appointed for (the benefit of) men, and (for) the pilgrimage; and it is not righteousness that you should enter the houses at their backs, but righteousness is this that one should guard (against evil); and go into the houses by their doors and be careful (of your duty) to Allah, that you may be successful.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "They ask you (O Muhammad SAW) about the new moons. Say: These are signs to mark fixed periods of time for mankind and for the pilgrimage. It is not Al-Birr (piety, righteousness, etc.) that you enter the houses from the back but Al-Birr (is the quality of the one) who fears Allah. So enter houses through their proper doors, and fear Allah that you may be successful.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "They ask thee of new moons. Say thou: they are time-marks to mankind and for pilgrimage. And it is not piety that ye enter your houses by the backs thereof, but Piety is of him who feareth God; so enter the houses by the doors thereof, and fear Allah that haply ye may thrive.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "They question you about the crescents. Say: 'They are times fixed for people and for the pilgrimage. ' Righteousness does not consist in entering dwellings from the back. But righteousness is he who wardsoff (sin). Enter dwellings by their doors and fear Allah, so that you will prosper.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "They ask thee regarding the new moons. Say, `they are time-marks for the people and the Pilgrimage. And it is no virtue that you come to the houses from their backs, but the virtue is that any fears God; so come to the houses by their doors and fear God that you may prosper.",
  "en_tr_sher": "They ask thee about the new moons. Say, 'They are means for measuring time, for the general convenience of people and for the Pilgrimage.'

And you should come into houses by the doors thereof; and fear God that you may prosper.",
  "en_tr_asad": "THEY WILL ASK thee about the new moons. Say: \"They indicate the periods for [various doings of] mankind, including the pilgrimage.\" \nHowever, piety does not consist in your entering houses from the rear, [as it were,] but truly pious is he who is conscious of God. Hence, enter houses through their doors, and remain conscious of God, so that you might attain to a happy state.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "They will question thee concerning the new moons. Say: They are appointed times for the people, and the Pilgrimage.

  "en_tr_maududi": "They ask you about the phases of the moan. Say, \"These are signs for the people to reckon dates and fix the periods for hajj.\"{{198}} Also tell them, \"It is no virtue to enter your houses from their backs during the Hajj days); real virtue is that one should refrain from incurring the displeasure of Allah; so enter your houses by their proper doors, and fear Allah so that you may gain (true) success.{{199}}",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "They ask thee concerning the New Moons{{202}}. Say: They are but signs to mark fixed periods of time in (the affairs of) men, and for Pilgrimage.

As a measure of time, where the lunar calendar is used, the New Moon is one great sign, for which people watch with eagerness. Muslim festivals, including the Pilgrimage are fixed by the appearance of the New Moon. The Arabs, among other superstitions, had one which made them enter their houses by the back door during or after the Pilgrimage. This is disapproved, for there is no virtue in any such artificial restrictions. All virtue proceeds from the love and fear of Allah."

This fixation on the lunar calendar results in a continuous variation of the seasonal circumstances in which those religious observances are performed (e.g., the length of the fasting-period between dawn and sunset, heat or cold at the time of the fast or the pilgrimage), and thus in a corresponding, periodical increase or decrease of the hardship involved. In addition to this, reckoning by lunar months has a bearing on the tide and ebb of the oceans, as well as on human physiology (e.g., a woman's monthly courses - a subject dealt with later on in this surah)."
