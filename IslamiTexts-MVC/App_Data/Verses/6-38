  "en_tr_qarib": "There is no crawling creature on the earth, nor a bird that flies with its two wings, but they are nations like you. We have neglected nothing in the Book. They shall all be gathered before their Lord.",

Life on the wing is separately mentioned. \"Ta'ir,\" which is ordinarily translated as \"bird,\" is anything that flies, including mammals like bats. In our pride we may exclude animals from our purview, but they all live a life, social and individual, like ourselves, and all life is subject to the Plan and Will of Allah. In 6:59 we are told that not a leaf falls but by His Will, and things dry and green are recorded in His Book. In other words they all obey His archetypal Plan, the Book which is also mentioned here. They are all answerable in their several degrees to His Plan (\"shall be gathered to their Lord in the end\"). This is not Pantheism: it is ascribing all life, activity, and existence to the Will and Plan of Allah."

The word ummah (of which umam is the plural) primarily denotes a group of living beings having certain characteristics or circumstances in common. Thus, it is often synonymous with \"community\", \"people\", \"nation\", \"genus\", \"generation\", and so forth. Inasmuch as every such grouping is characterized by the basic fact that its constituents (whether human or animal) are endowed with life, the term ummah sometimes signifies \"[God's] creatures\" (Lisan al-'Arab', with particular reference to this very Qur'an-verse; also Lane 1, 90). Thus, the meaning of the above passage is this: Man can detect God's \"signs\" or \"miracles\" in all the life-phenomena that surround him, and should, therefore, try to observe them with a view to better understanding \"God's way\" (sunnat Allah) - which is the Qur'anic term for what we call \"laws of nature\"."
