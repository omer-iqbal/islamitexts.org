This reference to the antecedents of the battle of Badr (see the introductory note to this surah) connects with the admonition given in verse 1, \"pay heed unto God and His Apostle\", as well as with the reminder, in verse 2, that true believers place all their trust in God. A few of the followers of the Prophet disliked the idea of giving battle to the main army of the Quraysh, instead of attacking the Meccan caravan returning from Syria and thus of acquiring easy booty; but the majority of them immediately declared that they would follow God's Apostle wherever he might lead them. - Some of the commentators are inclined to relate the adverbial particle kama (\"just as\" or \"even as\"), introducing this sentence, to the preceding passage and, thus, to their duty to follow God's commands. Others, however, regard this interpretation as somewhat laboured, and relate the comparison implied in kama to the first clause of verse 6, explaining the passage thus: \"Just as some of the believers were averse to going forth from Medina to give battle to the Quraysh, so, too, they would argue with thee as to whether it was really willed by God.\" This, in particular, was the view of Mujahid, whom Tabari quotes with approval in his commentary on this verse."
