If, on the other hand, juz is understood in its literal sense, the above sentence could have (as Razi assumes) a more general meaning, namely, \"they attribute a part of His divinity to some of the beings created by Him\". However, in view of the sequence, which clearly refers to the blasphemous attribution of \"offspring\" to God, my rendering seems to be preferable."
