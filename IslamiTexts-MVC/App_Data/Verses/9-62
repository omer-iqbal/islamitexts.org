This is made clear by the use of the singular pronoun in an yurduhu (\"that they should seek His pleasure\"), which is meant to bring out - in the inimitable elliptic form so characteristic of the Qur'an - the idea that God's pleasure is the only worthwhile goal of all human endeavour, and that a believer's duty to surrender to the Prophet's guidance is but an outcome of the fact that he is the bearer of God's message to man. Cf. in this connection, \"Whoever pays heed unto the Apostle pays heed unto God thereby\" (4:80), or, \"Say [O Prophet]: 'If you love God, follow me, [and] God will love you'\" (3:31)."
