  "en_tr_shakir": "And what reason have you that you should not eat of that on which Allah's name has been mentioned, and He has already made plain to you what He has forbidden to you-- excepting what you are compelled to; and most surely many would lead (people) astray by their low desires out of ignorance; surely your Lord-- He best knows those who exceed the limits.",

  "en_tr_ayubk": "And why should you not eat of that over which God's Name has been mentioned, when He has explained to you what He has made unlawful for you, unless you are constrained to it? But surely many lead astray by their caprices without any knowledge; surely thy Lord very well knows the transgressors.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And what reason have you that you should not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced when He has already explained to you that which He has forbidden unto you, -- save that which you are forced to.

  "en_tr_asad": "And why should you not eat of that over which God's name has been pronounced, seeing that He has so clearly spelled out to you what He has forbidden you [to eat] unless you are compelled [to do so]? But, behold, [it is precisely in such matters that] many people lead others astray by their own errant views, without [having any real] knowledge. Verily, thy Sustainer is fully aware of those who transgress the bounds of what is right.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "How is it with you, that you do not eat of that over which Gods Name has been mentioned, seeing that He has distinguished for you that He has forbidden you, unless you are constrained to it?

But your Lord knows well the transgressors.",
