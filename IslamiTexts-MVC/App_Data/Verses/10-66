The substantive pronoun man (\"whoever\") occurring twice in the first part of this verse contains an allusion to rational beings (as distinct from inanimate objects) whom \"those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God\" consider to be endowed with qualities or powers which, in fact, belong to Him alone. The Qur'an argues against this idolatrous concept by pointing out that all rational beings, whether men or angels, \"belong to God\" (i.e., are - like everything else in the universe - wholly dependent on Him for their existence), possessing no divine qualities and, therefore, no reality as objects of worship."
