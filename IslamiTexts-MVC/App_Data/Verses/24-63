  "ar_text_clean": "لا تجعلوا دعاء الرسول بينكم كدعاء بعضكم بعضا قد يعلم الله الذين يتسللون منكم لواذا فليحذر الذين يخالفون عن أمره أن تصيبهم فتنة أو يصيبهم عذاب أليم",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one of you to another: Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them, or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Make not the calling of the messenger among you as your calling one of another. Allah knoweth those of you who steal away, hiding themselves. And let those who conspire to evade orders beware lest grief or painful punishment befall them.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Do not hold the Messenger's calling (you) among you to be like your calling one to the other; Allah indeed knows those who steal away from among you, concealing themselves; therefore let those beware who go against his order lest a trial afflict them or there befall them a painful chastisement.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Make not the calling of the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) among you as your calling of one another. Allah knows those of you who slip away under shelter (of some excuse without taking the permission to leave, from the Messenger SAW). And let those who oppose the Messenger's (Muhammad SAW) commandment (i.e. his Sunnah legal ways, orders, acts of worship, statements, etc.) (among the sects) beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials, afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered by a tyrant, etc.) befall them or a painful torment be inflicted on them.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Place not the apostle's calling among you on the same footing as your calling of each other. Of a surety Allah knoweth those who slip away privately; let therefore those who oppose His commandment beware lest there befall them a trial or there befall them a torment afflictive.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Do not make the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling to one another. Allah knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously, so let those who disobey His command beware, lest they are struck by sedition, or, they are stricken with a painful punishment.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Do not make the calling of the Messenger among you like your calling of one another; God knows those of you who slip away stealthily; so let those who go against His command beware, lest a trial befall them, or a painful punishment befall them. ",
  "en_tr_sher": "Treat not the calling of the Messenger among you like the calling of one of you to another. God indeed knows those of you who steal away covertly. So let those who go against His command beware lest a trial afflict them or a grievous punishment overtake them.",
  "en_tr_asad": "DO NOT regard the Apostle's summons to you [in the same light] as a summons of one of you to another: God is indeed aware of those of you who would withdraw surreptitiously: so let those who would go against His bidding beware, lest a [bitter] trial befall them [in this world] or grievous suffering befall them [in the life to come].",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Make not the calling of the Messenger among yourselves like your calling one of another. God knows those of you who slip away surreptitiously; so let those who go against His command beware, lest a trial befall them, or there befall them a painful chastisement.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "O Believers, do not consider the summoning by the Messenger like the summoning among you by one another.{{102}} Allah knows well those of you who steal away, concealing themselves behind others.{{103}} Let those who disobey the order of the Messenger beware lest they should be involved in some affliction,{{104}} or are visited by a woeful scourge.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Deem not the summons of the Messenger among yourselves like the summons of one{{3048}} of you to another: Allah doth know those of you who slip away under shelter of some excuse: then let those beware who withstand the Messenger's order, lest some trial befall them,{{3049}} or a grievous penalty be inflicted on them.",
  "en_ctr_asad": "DO NOT regard the Apostle's summons to you{{92}} [in the same light] as a summons of one of you to another: God is indeed aware of those of you who would withdraw surreptitiously: so let those who would go against His bidding beware, lest a [bitter] trial befall them [in this world] or grievous suffering befall them [in the life to come].",
