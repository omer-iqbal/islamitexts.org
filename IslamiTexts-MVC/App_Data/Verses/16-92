  "en_tr_yusuf": "And be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong. Nor take your oaths to practise deception between yourselves, lest one party should be more numerous than another: for Allah will test you by this; and on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make clear to you (the truth of) that wherein ye disagree.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And be not like unto her who unravelleth the thread, after she hath made it strong, to thin filaments, making your oaths a deceit between you because of a nation being more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only trieth you thereby, and He verily will explain to you on the Day of Resurrection that wherein ye differed.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And be not like her who unravels her yarn, disintegrating it into pieces after she has spun it strongly. You make your oaths to be means of deceit between you because (one) nation is more numerous than (another) nation. Allah only tries you by this; and He will most certainly make clear to you on the resurrection day that about which you differed.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And be not like her who undoes the thread which she has spun after it has become strong, by taking your oaths a means of deception among yourselves, lest a nation may be more numerous than another nation. Allah only tests you by this [i.e who obeys Allah and fulfills Allah's Covenant and who disobeys Allah and breaks Allah's Covenant]. And on the Day of Resurrection, He will certainly make clear to you that wherein you used to differ [i.e. a believer confesses and believes in the Oneness of Allah and in the Prophethood of Prophet Muhammad SAW which the disbeliever denies it and that was their difference amongst them in the life of this world].",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And be not like unto her who unravelleth her yarn into strands after its strength, holding your oaths a means of discord amongst you that a community may be more numerous than anot her community; Allah only proveth you there by; and He will surely manifest unto you on the Judgment Day that wherein ye have been differing.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Do not be like the woman who breaks her thread, after it is firmly spun into fibers, by taking your oaths as mere mutual deceit, one nation being more numerous than the other. Allah tries you with it. On the Day of Resurrection, He will clarify to you everything on which you were at variance.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And be not like her who broke her thread, after it was firmly spun, into bits. You take your oaths as a deceit between you, lest a community may become more powerful than another community. God only tries you thereby; and He will surely make clear to you, on the Day of Resurrection, in what you differed.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And be not like unto her who cuts up her yarn into pieces after having spun it strong by making your oaths a means of deceit between you, for fear lest one people become more powerful than another people. Surely, God tries you therewith, and on the Day of Resurrection He will make clear to you that wherein you differed.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Hence, be not like her who breaks and completely untwists the yarn which she [herself] has spun and made strong &ndash; [be not like this by] using your oaths as a means of deceiving one another, simply because some of you may be more powerful than others.\nBy all this, God but puts you to a test &ndash; and [He does it] so that on Resurrection Day He might make clear unto you all that on which you were wont to differ.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And be not as a woman who breaks her thread, after it is firmly spun, into fibres, by taking your oaths as mere mutual deceit, one nation being more numerous than another nation. God only tries you thereby; and certainly He will make clear to you upon the Day of Resurrection that whereon you were at variance.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And do not become like the woman who, after having painstakingly spun her yarn, caused it to disintegrate into pieces.{{90}} You resort to oaths as instruments of mutual deceit so that one people might take greater advantage than another although Allah puts you to the test through this.{{91}} Surely on the Day of Resurrection{{92}} He will make clear the Truth concerning the matters over which you differed.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "And be not like a woman who breaks into untwisted strands the yarn which she has spun, after it has become strong.{{2129}} Nor{{2130}} take your oaths to practise deception between yourselves, lest one party should be more numerous than another:{{2131}} for Allah will test you by this; and on the Day of Judgment He will certainly make clear to you (the truth of) that wherein ye disagree.{{2132}}",
  "en_ctr_asad": "Hence, be not like her who breaks and completely untwists the yarn which she [herself] has spun and made strong - [be not like this by] using your oaths as a means of deceiving one another,{{113}} simply because some of you may be more powerful than others.{{114}} By all this, God but puts you to a test - and [He does it] so that on Resurrection Day He might make clear unto you all that on which you were wont to differ.{{115}}",
