  "en_tr_yusuf": "O Messenger! let not those grieve thee, who race each other into unbelief: (whether it be) among those who say \"We believe\" with their lips but whose hearts have no faith; or it be among the Jews,- men who will listen to any lie,- will listen even to others who have never so much as come to thee. They change the words from their (right) times and places: they say, \"If ye are given this, take it, but if not, beware!\" If any one's trial is intended by Allah, thou hast no authority in the least for him against Allah. For such - it is not Allah's will to purify their hearts. For them there is disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a heavy punishment.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "O Messenger! Let not them grieve thee who vie one with another in the race to disbelief, of such as say with their mouths: \"We believe,\" but their hearts believe not, and of the Jews: listeners for the sake of falsehood, listeners on behalf of other folk who come not unto thee, changing words from their context and saying: If this be given unto you, receive it, but if this be not given unto you, then beware! He whom Allah doometh unto sin, thou (by thine efforts) wilt avail him naught against Allah. Those are they for whom the Will of Allah is that He cleanse not their hearts. Theirs in the world will be ignominy, and in the Hereafter an awful doom;",
  "en_tr_shakir": "O Messenger! let not those grieve you who strive together in hastening to unbelief from among those who say with their mouths: We believe, and their hearts do not believe, and from among those who are Jews; they are listeners for the sake of a lie, listeners for another people who have not come to you; they alter the words from their places, saying: If you are given this, take it, and if you are not given this, be cautious; and as for him whose temptation Allah desires, you cannot control anything for him with Allah. Those are they for whom Allah does not desire that He should purify their hearts; they shall have disgrace in this world, and they shall have a grievous chastisement in the hereafter.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "O Messenger (Muhammad SAW)! Let not those who hurry to fall into disbelief grieve you, of such who say: \"We believe\" with their mouths but their hearts have no faith. And of the Jews are men who listen much and eagerly to lies - listen to others who have not come to you. They change the words from their places; they say, \"If you are given this, take it, but if you are not given this, then beware!\" And whomsoever Allah wants to put in Al-Fitnah [error, because of his rejecting the Faith], you can do nothing for him against Allah. Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify (from disbelief and hypocrisy); for them there is a disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter a great torment.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "O apostle! let not those grieve thee that hasten after infidelity from among these who say with their mouths: we believe, yet their hearts believe not, and from among those who are Judaised: listeners to falsehoods, listeners to anot her people who come not unto thee; they pervert the words after they have been set in their places, saying:  if that which is given you be this accept it, but if that is not given you, beware. And whosesoever temptation Allah Willeth, thou shalt not avail him against Allah in aught. These are they whose hearts Allah would not cleanse; theirs is humiliation in this world and theirs shall  be in the Hereafter a mighty torment.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "O Messenger, do not grieve for those who race into disbelief; those who say with their mouth: 'We believe, ' yet their hearts did not believe, and the Jews who listen to lies and listen to other nations who have not come to you. They pervert the words in their places and say: 'If you are given this, accept it; if not, then beware! ' Whomsoever Allah wishes to try, you will not own anything with Allah concerning him. For those whose hearts Allah does not will to purify shall be disgrace in this world and a grievous punishment in the Everlasting Life.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "O Messenger, let those who hasten to unbelief not grieve thee, out of those who say with their mouths, `we believe', but their hearts have not believed; and out of the Jews who listen to falsehood, and listen to other people who have not come to thee. Perverting Words from their places, they say, `if you are given this, take it, and if you are not given it beware.' But whomso God desires to put to trial, thou canst not avail him with God anything; those are the ones whose hearts God has desired not to purify; for them shall be disgrace in this world, and for them shall be a big punishment in the Hereafter.",
  "en_tr_sher": "O Messenger! let not those grieve thee who hasten to fall into disbelief -- those who say with their mouths, 'We believe,' but their hearts believe not. And among the Jews too are those who would fondly listen to any lie -- who listen for conveying it to other people who have not come to thee. They pervert words after their being put in their right places; and say, 'If you are given this, then accept it, but if you are not given this, then keep away from it.' And as for him whom God desires to try, thou shalt not avail him aught against God. These are they whose hearts God has not been pleased to purify; they shall have disgrace in this world, and in the Hereafter they shall have a severe punishment.",
  "en_tr_asad": "O APOSTLE! be not grieved by those who vie with one another in denying the truth: such as those who say with their mouths, \"We believe,\" the while their hearts do not believe; and such of the Jewish faith as eagerly listen to any falsehood, eagerly listen to other people without having come to thee [for enlightenment]. They distort the meaning of the [revealed] words, taking them out of their context, saying [to themselves], \"If such-and-such [teaching] is vouchsafed unto you, accept it; but if it is not vouchsafed unto you, be on your guard!\" \n[Be not grieved by them &ndash;] for, if God wills anyone to be tempted to evil, thou canst in no wise prevail with God in his behalf.\nIt is they whose hearts God is not willing to cleanse. Theirs shall be ignominy in this world, and awesome suffering in the life to come &ndash;",
  "en_tr_arberry": "O Messenger, let them not grieve thee that vie with one another in unbelief, such men as say with their mouths We believe but their hearts believe not; and the Jews who listen to falsehood, listen to other folk, who have not come to thee, perverting words from their meanings, saying, If you are given this, then take it; if you are not given it, beware! Whomsoever God desires to try, thou canst not avail him anything with God. Those are they whose hearts God desired not to purify; for them is degradation in this world; and in the world to come awaits them a mighty chastisement;",
  "en_tr_maududi": "O Messenger! Do not be grieved on account of those who vie with one another in disbelieving:{{62}} even though they be those who say with their mouths: 'We believe' even though their hearts have no faith; or they be Jews who have their ears eagerly turned to falsehood{{63}} and spy for other people who did not chance to come to you,{{64}} who pervert the words of Allah, taking them out of their proper context in order to distort their meaning.{{65}} They say to people: 'If such and such teaching is given to you, accept it; if you are not given that, then beware!{{66}} You can be of no avail to him whom Allah wills to fall into error.{{67}} Those are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want to purify.{{68}} For them there is degradation in this world and a mighty chastisement in the Next.",
