He wandered in quest of Unity and found it by the guidance of Allah. There is no implication whatever of sin or error on his part. But we may err and find ourselves wandering in mazes of error, in thought, motive, or understanding: we must pray for Allah's grace ever to give us guidance.<br/>The Arabic root dalla has various shades of meaning. In 1:7, I have translated it by the verb \"stray\". In 53:2 the Prophet is defended from the charge of being \"astray\" or straying in mind. In 12:8 and 12:95 Jacob's sons use the word for their aged father, to suggest that he was senile and wandering in mind. In 32:10 it is used of the dead, and I have translated it \"hidden and lost\" (in the earth)."
