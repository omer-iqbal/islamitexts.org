But the great majority of the classical commentators hold that the meaning is \"they repay evil with good\"; thus Al-Hasan al-Basra (as quoted by Baghawi, Zamakhshari and Razi): \"When they are deprived [of anything], they give; and when they are wronged, they forgive.\" Tabari's explanation is very similar: \"They repel the evil done to them by doing good to those who did it\"; and \"they do not repay evil with evil, but repel it by [doing] good\".
