There are three features of this, thus giving the third, fourth, and fifth points. (3) Their movement is compared to that of gliding or swimming (sabhan). In 21:33 this verb is applied to the motion of the celestial bodies: they all \"swim along, each in its rounded course\". Cf. Shakespeare, Merchant of Venice : \"There's not an orb which thou behold'st, But in his motion life and angel sings, Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubims\". (4) In hurrying on their errands angels press forth as in a race. (5) And thus they promptly execute the orders of their Lord (Cf. 35:1)."
