He was hated by his brothers and sold by them into slavery: they were sending him into the land of Egypt, where he was to rule men.

His own vision of star, sun, and moon prostrating themselves before him, was no idle dream of a selfish fool, but the prefigurernent of a power, which, used rightly, was to make his own honour an instrument of service to millions he had not seen, through men and women whose own power and dignity were sanctified through him. He was to understand the hidden meaning of what seemed futilities, blunderings, snares, evil plottings, love gone wrong, and power used tyrannically. He was to interpret truth to those who would never have reached it otherwise."
