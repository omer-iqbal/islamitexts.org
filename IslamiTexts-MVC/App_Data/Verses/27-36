But the effect of the embassy with presents was the very opposite. Solomon took it as an insult that she should send her presents instead of her submission to the true Religion! He flung back the presents at her, as much as to say, \"Let these baubles delight your own hearts! Allah has blessed me with plenty of worldly goods, and something infinitely better, viz.: His Light and Guidance! Why do you say nothing about that? Will you only understand the argument of armies and violence?\" Or perhaps his speech was only meant for the Sabaean crowd. For when she actually came, he treated her kindly, and she accepted the religion of Unity."
