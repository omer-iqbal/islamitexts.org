This noun is derived from the verb 'adana, which primarily denotes \"he remained [somewhere]\" or \"he kept [to something]\", i.e., permanently: cf. the phrase 'adantu 'l-balad (\"I remained for good [or \"settled\"] in the country\"). In Biblical Hebrew - which, after all, is but a very ancient Arabian dialect - the closely related noun 'eden has also the additional connotation of \"delight\", \"pleasure\" or \"bliss\". Hence the combination of the two concepts in my rendering of 'adn as \"perpetual bliss\". As in many other places in the Qur'an, this bliss is here allegorized - and thus brought closer to man's imagination - by means of descriptions recalling earthly joys."
