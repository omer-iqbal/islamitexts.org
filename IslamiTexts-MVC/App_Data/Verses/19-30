Tabari himself applies the same interpretation to the next verse, explaining it thus: \"He has decreed that He would enjoin upon me prayer and charity\". However, the whole of this passage (verses 30-33) may also be understood as having been uttered by Jesus at a much later time - namely, after he had reached maturity and been actually entrusted with his prophetic mission: that is to say, it may be understood as an anticipatory description of the ethical and moral principles which were to dominate the adult life of Jesus and particularly his deep consciousness of being only \"a servant of God\"."
