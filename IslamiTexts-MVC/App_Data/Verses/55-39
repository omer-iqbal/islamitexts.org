As to the Judge on the Throne of Judgement, He will of course know all before Judgement is set up. But to give every chance to the accused, his record will be produced and shown to him (69:19,25; 18:49), and he will be given a chance to plead (7:53), but if a sinner, he will be in confusion (28:66)."
