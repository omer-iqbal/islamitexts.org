As regards the noun dari' - which is said to be a bitter, thorny plant in its dried state (Jawhari) - it is to be borne in mind that it is derived from the verb dara'a or dari'a, which signifies \"he [or \"it\"] became abject\" or \"abased\" (ibid.): hence my rendering of this (obviously metaphorical) expression as \"the bitterness of dry thorns\". A similarly metaphorical meaning attaches to the expression \"a boiling spring\" in verse 5, which recalls the term hamim so often mentioned in the Qur'an (see note 62 on the last sentence of 6:70)."
