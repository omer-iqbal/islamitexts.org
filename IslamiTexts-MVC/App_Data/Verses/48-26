The Prophet began to dictate to Ali ibn Abi Tilib the text of the proposed agreement: \"Write down, 'In the name of God, the Most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace'\"; but Suhayl interrupted him and said: \"We have never heard of [the expression] 'the Most Gracious'; write down only what we know.\" Whereupon the Prophet said to Ali: \"Write, then, 'In Thy name, O God'.\" Ali wrote as he was told; and the Prophet continued: \"This is what has been agreed upon between Muhammad, God's Apostle, and the people of Mecca ...\". But Suhayl interrupted again: \"If thou wert [really] an apostle of God, [this would be an admission on our part that] we have been doing wrong to thee; write, therefore, as we understand it.\" And so the Prophet dictated to 'Ali: \"Write thus: 'This is what has been agreed upon between Muhammad, the son of Abd Allah, son of Abd al-Muttalib, and the people of Mecca ...\" (This story is recorded in many versions, among others by Nasa'i, Iba Hanbal and Tabari.)"
