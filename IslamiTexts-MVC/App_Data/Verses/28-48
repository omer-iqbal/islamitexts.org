The remedies which his age and future ages required (for his Message was universal) were different. His miracle of the Qur'an was different and most permanent than the Rod and the Radiant- White Hand of Moses.

It is this very statement which induced the opponents of Muhammad in his own time as well as in later times - to question the authenticity of the Qur'an: \"If it had really been revealed by God,\" they argue, \"would so many of its propositions, especially its social laws, differ so radically from the laws promulgated in that earlier divine writ, the Torah?\" By advancing this argument (and quite apart from the question of whether the text of the Bible as we know it today has or has not been corrupted in the course of time), the opponents of Muhammad's message deliberately overlook the fact, repeatedly stressed in the Qur'an, that the earlier systems of law were conditioned by the spiritual level of a particular people and the exigencies of a particular chapter of human history, and therefore had to be superseded by new laws at a higher stage of human development (see in this connection the second paragraph of 5:48 and the corresponding note 66). However, as is evident from the immediate sequence - and especially from the last sentence of this verse - the above specious argument is not meant to uphold the authenticity of the Bible as against that of the Qur'an, but, rather, aims at discrediting both - and, through them, the basic religious principle against which the irreligious mind always revolts: namely, the idea of divine revelation and of man's absolute dependence on and responsibility to God, the Ultimate Cause of all that exists."
