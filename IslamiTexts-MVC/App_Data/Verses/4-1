The mother that bore us must ever have our reverence. The wife, through whom we enter parentage, must have our reverence. Sex, which governs so much our physical life, and has so much influence on our emotional and higher nature, deserves-not our fear, or our contempt, or our amused indulgence, but-our reverence in the highest sense of the term (Cf. 30:21). With this fitting introduction we enter on a discussion of women, orphans, and family relationships."

      "note": "Out of the many meanings attributable to the term nafs - soul, spirit, mind, animate being, living entity, human being, person, self (in the sense of a personal identity), humankind, life-essence, vital principle, and so forth - most of the classical commentators choose \"human being\", and assume that it refers here to Adam. Muhammad 'Abduh, however, rejects this interpretation (Manar IV, 323 ff.) and gives, instead, his preference to \"humankind\" inasmuch as this term stresses the common origin and brotherhood of the human race (which, undoubtedly, is the purport of the above verse), without, at the same time, unwarrantably tying it to the Biblical account of the creation of Adam and Eve. My rendering of nafs, in this context, as \"living entity\" follows the same reasoning - As regards the expression zawjaha (\"its mate\"), it is to be noted that, with reference to animate beings, the term zawj (\"a pair\", \"one of a pair\" or \"a mate\") applies to the male as well as to the female component of a pair or couple; hence, with reference to human beings, it signifies a woman's mate (husband) as well as a man's mate (wife). Abu Muslim - as quoted by Razi - interprets the phrase \"He created out of it (minha) its mate\" as meaning \"He created its mate [i.e., its sexual counterpart] out of its own kind (min jinsiha)\", thus supporting the view of Muhammad Abduh referred to above. The literal translation of minha as \"out of it\" clearly alludes, in conformity with the text, to the biological fact that both sexes have originated from \"one living entity\"."
