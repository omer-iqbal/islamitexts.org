The above sentence can be understood in either of these two senses, depending on whether one relates the expression \"alone\" (wahid) to God - thus stressing His uniqueness as Creator - or to this particular object of His creation, man, who begins and ends his life in a state of utter loneliness (cf. 6:94 and 19:80 and 95). In either case, our attention is drawn to the fact of man's inescapable dependence on God. Beyond that, the phrase in question carries a further meaning, namely, \"Leave it to Me alone to decide what to do with him who forgets that I am his Creator and Sustainer\" - thus forbidding any human punishment of \"those who deny the truth\"."
