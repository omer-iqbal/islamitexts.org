Allah's purpose will be accomplished, I with or without us. But our failure to respond to His will must leave us spiritually poorer, bereft of grace and guidance: \"for Allah guides not the rebellious\". This is of universal application. But it was strikingly illustrated in the case of those faithful ones who obeyed the Prophet's call, left the comfort of their homes in Makkah and suffered exile in Madinah, gave up their trade and their possessions, strove and fought for Allah's cause, sometimes against their own kith and kin or their own tribesmen who were enemies of Islam. They won through. Others were not prepared for such sacrifice, but their failure did not stop the accomplishment of Allah's plan and purpose."
