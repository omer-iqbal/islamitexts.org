  "en_tr_shakir": "And that you should judge between them by what Allah has revealed, and do not follow their low desires, and be cautious of them, lest they seduce you from part of what Allah has revealed to you; but if they turn back, then know that Allah desires to afflict them on account of some of their faults; and most surely many of the people are transgressors.",

Many of the people are wrongdoers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "and that thou judgest between them according to what God has sent down, but follow not their caprices and beware of them, lest they tempt thee away from some of what God has sent down to thee.

  "en_tr_asad": "Hence, judge between the followers of earlier revelation in accordance with what God has bestowed from on high, and do not follow their errant views; and beware of them, lest they tempt thee away from aught that God has bestowed from on high upon thee.
