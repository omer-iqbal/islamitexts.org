Nay, but Allah's is the whole command. Do not those who believe know that, had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind? As for those who disbelieve, disaster ceaseth not to strike them because of what they do, or it dwelleth near their home until the threat of Allah come to pass. Lo! Allah faileth not to keep the tryst.",

And a rattling adversity ceaseth not to befall those who disbelieve for that which they have wrought or to alight nigh unto their habitation. until Allah's promise cometh; verily Allah faileth not the tryst.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "If only a Koran whereby the mountains were set in motion, or the earth cleaved asunder, or the dead spoken to. No, but to Allah is the affair altogether. Do those who believe know that had Allah willed He could have guided all people? As for those who disbelieve, because of what they do, disaster will not cease to afflict them, or it alights near their home until the promise of Allah comes. Allah will not break His promise.",

But unbelievers -- the shattering disaster shall not cease to afflict them or alight near their homes, for what they have worked, until God's promise comes; surely God fails not the appointed time.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And if there was a Qur'?n by which mountains could be moved or by which the earth could be cut asunder or by which the dead could be spoken to, they would still not believe in it. Nay, the matter of their believing rests entirely with God. Have not the believers yet come to know that if God had enforced His will He could have surely guided all mankind? And as for those who disbelieve, disaster shall not cease to befall them for what they have wrought or to alight near their home, until the promise of God comes to pass. Surely, God fails not in His promise.",

Have, then, they who have attained to faith not yet come to know that, had God so willed, He would indeed have guided all mankind aright?\nBut as for those who are bent on denying the truth &ndash; in result of their [evil] deeds, sudden calamities will always befall them or will alight close to their homes; [and this will continue] until God's promise [of resurrection] is fulfilled: verily, God never fails to fulfil His promise!",
