  "en_tr_yusuf": "If thou dost marvel (at their want of faith), strange is their saying: \"When we are (actually) dust, shall we indeed then be in a creation renewed?\" They are those who deny their Lord! They are those round whose necks will be yokes (of servitude): they will be Companions of the Fire, to dwell therein (for aye)!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And if thou wonderest, then wondrous is their saying: When we are dust, are we then forsooth (to be raised) in a new creation? Such are they who disbelieve in their Lord; such have carcans on their necks; such are rightful owners of the Fire, they will abide therein.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And if you would wonder, then wondrous is their saying: What! when we are dust, shall we then certainly be in a new creation? These are they who disbelieve in their Lord, and these have chains on their necks, and they are the inmates of the fire; in it they shall abide.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And if you (O Muhammad SAW) wonder (at these polytheists who deny your message of Islamic Monotheism and have taken besides Allah others for worship who can neither harm nor benefit), then wondrous is their saying: \"When we are dust, shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new creation?\" They are those who disbelieve in their Lord!
