  "en_tr_yusuf": "If indeed thou ask them who it is that created the heavens and the earth, they would be sure to say, \"Allah\". Say: \"See ye then? the things that ye invoke besides Allah,- can they, if Allah wills some Penalty for me, remove His Penalty?- Or if He wills some Grace for me, can they keep back his Grace?\" Say: \"Sufficient is Allah for me! In Him trust those who put their trust.\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And verily, if thou shouldst ask them: Who created the heavens and the earth? they will say: Allah. Say: Bethink you then of those ye worship beside Allah, if Allah willed some hurt for me, could they remove from me His hurt; or if He willed some mercy for me, could they restrain His mercy? Say: Allah is my all. In Him do (all) the trusting put their trust.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And should you ask them, Who created the heavens and the earth? They would most certainly say: Allah. Say: Have you then considered that what you call upon besides Allah, would they, if Allah desire to afflict me with harm, be the removers of His harm, or (would they), if Allah desire to show me mercy, be the withholders of His mercy? Say: Allah is sufficient for me; on Him do the reliant rely.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And verily, if you ask them: \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" Surely, they will say: \"Allah (has created them).\" Say: \"Tell me then, the things that you invoke besides Allah, if Allah intended some harm for me, could they remove His harm, or if He (Allah) intended some mercy for me, could they withhold His Mercy?\" Say : \"Sufficient for me is Allah; in Him those who trust (i.e. believers) must put their trust.\"",

Say thou: bethink ye then that those whom ye call upon beside Allah, - could they if Allah intended some hurt for me, remove His hurt?  or if He intended some mercy for me, could they withhold His mercy? Say thou:enough for me is Allah; in Him the trusting put their trust.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "If you ask them who created the heavens and the earth, they will reply: 'Allah. ' Say: 'Do you think that, if Allah wills to afflict me those you call upon, other than Him, could remove His affliction, or, that if He wills to let me have mercy, they could withhold His Mercy? ' Say: 'Allah suffices me. Those who put their trust, put their trust in Him. '",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And if thou askest them, `who created the heavens and the earth', they will surely say, `God'. Say, `have you then considered that those whom you call, apart from God __ if God desires any harm for me, shall they remove harm given by Him? Or if He desires to show mercy to me, shall they withhold His mercy?' Say, `God is enough for me; in Him trust those who trust'.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And if thou ask them, 'Who created the heavens and the earth?' They will, surely, say, 'God.' Say, 'What think ye, if God intends to do me harm, will those whom you call upon beside God be able to remove the harm He may intend? Or, if He wills to show me mercy, could they withhold His mercy?' Say, 'God is sufficient for me. In Him trust those who would trust.'",
  "en_tr_asad": "And thus it is [with most people]: if thou ask them, \"Who is it that has created the heavens and the earth?\" &ndash; they will surely answer, \"God.\" \nSay: \"Have you, then, ever considered what it is that you invoke instead of God? If God wills that harm should befall me, could those [imaginary powers] remove the harm inflicted by Him? Or, if He wills that grace should alight on me, could they withhold His grace [from me]?\"\nSay: \"God is enough for me! In Him [alone] place their trust all who have trust [in His existence].\"",
  "en_tr_arberry": "If thou askest them, Who created the heavens and the earth? they will say, God. Say: What think you? That you call upon apart from God -- if God desires affliction for me, shall they remove His affliction? Or if He desires mercy for me, shall they withhold His mercy? Say: God is enough for me; in Him all those put their trust who put their trust.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "If you ask them: \"Who created the heavens and the earth?\" they will surely answer: \"Allah.\" Tell them: \"What do you think, then, of the deities whom you call upon instead of Allah?

They admit the existence of Allah as an abstract proposition, but it has not come into their hearts and souls: it has not been translated into their lives. They run after false worship on account of ancestral custom or on account of their thoughtlessness or false environment, or on account of their own selfish desires or limited outlook.
