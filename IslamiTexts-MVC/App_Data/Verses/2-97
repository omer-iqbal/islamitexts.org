      "note": "A party of the Jews in the time of Muhammad ridiculed the Muslim belief that Gabriel brought down revelations to Muhammad Al Mustafa. Michael was called in their books \"the great prince which standeth for the children of thy people\": (Daniel, 12:1). The vision of Gabriel inspired fear (Daniel, 13:16-17). But this pretence-that Michael was their friend and Gabriel their enemy-was merely a manifestation of their unbelief in angels, Prophets and Allah Himself; and such unbelief could not win the love of Allah. In any case it was disingenuous to say that they believed in one angel and not in another. Muhammad's inspiration was through visions of Gabriel. Muhammad had been helped to the highest spiritual light, and the message which he delivered and his spodess integrity and exemplary life were manifest Signs which every one could understand except those who were obstinate and perverse. Besides, the verses of the Qur'an were in themselves reasonable and clear."
