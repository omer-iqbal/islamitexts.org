For further details relating to the division of spoils of war, see verse 41 of this surah. - The immediate occasion of this revelation was the question of the booty acquired by the Muslims - in the battle of Badr (an account of which is given in the introductory note to this surah); but the principle enunciated above is valid for all times and circumstances."
