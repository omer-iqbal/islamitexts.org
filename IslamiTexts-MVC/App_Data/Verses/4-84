      "note": "The courage of Muhammad was as notable as his wisdom, his gentleness, and his trust in Allah. Facing fearful odds, he often stood alone, and took the whole responsibility on himself. But his example and visible trust in Allah inspired and roused the Muslims, and also-speaking purely from a human point of view-res trained the fury of his enemies. When we consider that he was Allah's inspired Messenger to carry out His Plan, we can see that nothing can resist that Plan. If the enemy happens to have strength, power, or resources, Allah's strength, power, and resources are infinitely greater. If the enemy is meditating punishment on the righteous for their righteousness, Allah's punishment for such wickedness will be infinitely greater and more effective."

      "note": "The term harad signifies \"corruption of body or mind\" or \"corruption in one's conduct\", as well as \"constant disquietude of mind\" (Qamus). According to Raghib, the verbal form harradahu means \"he rid him of all harad\" - analogous to the expression marradahu, \"he rid him of illness (marad)\". In the two instances where this verb occurs in the Qur'an (in this verse as well as in 8:65), it has the imperative form: \"Render the believers free of all disquietude of mind\" or, tropically, \"of all fear of death\" - and may, thus, be suitably expressed as \"inspire the believers to overcome all fear of death\". The usual rendering of the phrase harrid al-mu minin as \"urge (or \"rouse\" or \"stir up\") the believers\" does not convey the full meaning of the verb harrada, notwithstanding the fact that it has been suggested by some of the classical philologists (cf. Lane II, 548)."
