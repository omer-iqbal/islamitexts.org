  "en_tr_yusuf": "Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: \"Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear Allah.\" But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And when thou saidst unto him on whom Allah hath conferred favour and thou hast conferred favour: Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear Allah. And thou didst hide in thy mind that which Allah was to bring to light, and thou didst fear mankind whereas Allah hath a better right that thou shouldst fear Him. So when Zeyd had performed that necessary formality (of divorce) from her, We gave her unto thee in marriage, so that (henceforth) there may be no sin for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have performed the necessary formality (of release) from them. The commandment of Allah must be fulfilled.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And when you said to him to whom Allah had shown favor and to whom you had shown a favor: Keep your wife to yourself and be careful of (your duty to) Allah; and you concealed in your soul what Allah would bring to light, and you feared men, and Allah had a greater right that you should fear Him. But when Zaid had accomplished his want of her, We gave her to you as a wife, so that there should be no difficulty for the believers in respect of the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their want of them; and Allah's command shall be performed.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And (remember) when you said to him (Zaid bin Harithah radhiallahu'anhu the freed-slave of the Prophet SAW) on whom Allah has bestowed Grace (by guiding him to Islam) and you (O Muhammad SAW too) have done favour (by manumitting him) \"Keep your wife to yourself, and fear Allah.\" But you did hide in yourself (i.e. what Allah has already made known to you that He will give her to you in marriage) that which Allah will make manifest, you did fear the people (i.e., Muhammad SAW married the divorced wife of his manumitted slave) whereas Allah had a better right that you should fear Him. So when Zaid had accomplished his desire from her (i.e. divorced her), We gave her to you in marriage, so that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the believers in respect of (the marriage of) the wives of their adopted sons when the latter have no desire to keep them (i.e. they have divorced them). And Allah's Command must be fulfilled.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And recall what time thou wast saying unto him on whom Allah had conferred favour and thou hadst conferred favour: keep thy wife to thyself and fear Allah; so and thou wast concealing in thy mind that which Allah was going to disclose, and thou wast fearing mankind, whereas Allah had a better right that Him thou shouldst fear. Then when Zaid had performed his purpose concerning her, We wedded her to thee, that there should be no blame for believers in respect of wives of their adopted sons, when they have performed their purpose concerning them. And the ordinance of Allah was to be fulfilled.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "And when you said to he whom Allah had favored and yourself have favored: 'Keep your wife and fear Allah, ' and you sought to hide in yourself what Allah was to reveal, fearing people; although Allah has a better right for you to fear Him. And when Zayd had accomplished what he would of her (divorce), We gave her to you (Prophet Muhammad) in marriage, so that there is no fault in believers concerning (marriage to) the former spouse of their foster children if they divorced them. The decree of Allah must be done.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And when thou wast saying to him whom God had blessed and thou hadst favoured, `keep thy wife to thyself and fear God', and thou wast concealing in thy heart what God would reveal, and thou wast fearing people, though God had a better right that thou shouldst fear Him. Then, when Zaid had accomplished formalities concerning her, We gave her in marriage to thee, so that there should be no blame on the Believers concerning the wives of their adopted sons, when they accomplish formalities concerning them; and God's command is ever done.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And call to mind when thou didst say to him on whom God had bestowed favours and on whom thou also hadst bestowed favours: 'Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God,' and thou didst conceal in thy heart what God was going to bring to light, and thou didst fear the people, whereas God has better right that thou shouldst fear Him. Then, when Zaid had accomplished his want concerning her, We joined her in marriage to thee, so that there may be no difficulty for the believers with regard to marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished their wants concerning them. And God's decree was bound to be fulfilled.",
  "en_tr_asad": "AND LO, [O Muhammad,] thou didst say unto the one to whom God had shown favour and to whom thou hadst shown favour, \"Hold on to thy wife, and remain conscious of God!\" And [thus] wouldst thou hide within thyself something that God was about to bring to light &ndash; for thou didst stand in awe of [what] people [might think], whereas it was God alone of whom thou shouldst have stood in awe! \n[But] then, when Zayd had come to the end of his union with her, We gave her to thee in marriage, so that [in future] no blame should attach to the believers for [marrying] the spouses of their adopted children when the latter have come to the end of their union with them. And [thus] God's will was done.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "When thou saidst to him whom God had blessed and thou hadst favoured, Keep thy wife to thyself, and fear God, and thou wast concealing within thyself what God should reveal, fearing other men; and God has better right for thee to fear Him. So when Zaid had accomplished what he would of her, then We gave her in marriage to thee, so that there should not be any fault in the believers, touching the wives of their adopted sons, when they have accomplished what they would of them; and Gods commandment must be performed.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "(O Prophet),{{67}} call to mind when you said to him{{68}} whom Allah had favoured and you had favoured: \"Cleave to your wife and fear Allah,\"{{69}} and you concealed within yourself for fear of people what Allah was to reveal, although Allah has greater right that you fear Him.{{70}} So when Zayd had accomplished what he would of her,{{71}} We gave her in marriage to you{{72}} so that there should not be any constraint for the believers regarding the wives of their adopted sons after they had accomplished whatever they would of them.{{73}} And Allah's command was bound to be accomplished.",
