  "en_tr_yusuf": "But when good (times) came, they said, \"This is due to us;\" When gripped by calamity, they ascribed it to evil omens connected with Moses and those with him! Behold! in truth the omens of evil are theirs in Allah's sight, but most of them do not understand!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "But whenever good befell them, they said: This is ours; and whenever evil smote them they ascribed it to the evil auspices of Moses and those with him. Surely their evil auspice was only with Allah. But most of them knew not.",

  "en_tr_dbadi": "So whenever good-hap came unto them, they would say: ours is this. And if a mishap afflicted them, they would lay it to the evil augury of Musa and these with him. Behold! their evil augury was only with Allah, but most of them knew not.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "When good things came their way, they said: 'It is our due, ' but when evil befell them they blamed their ill fortune on Moses and those with him. Indeed their ill fortune was with Allah, though most of them did not know.",

  "en_tr_sher": "But whenever good befell them, they said, 'This is for us.' And if evil afflicted them, they ascribed the evil fortune to Moses and those with him. Now, surely, the cause of their evil fortune was with God. But most of them know not.",

They did not look within themselves to see the root of evil, and the cause of their punishment! So it happens in all ages. People blame the righteous for something which they do, different from other men, instead of searching out their own lapses from rectitude, which are punished by Allah, (Cf. 36:18-19)."

      "note": "The phrase tatayyara bihi signifies \"he attributed an evil omen to him\" or \"he augured evil, from him\". It is based on the pre-Islamic Arab custom of divining the future or establishing an omen from the flight of birds. Thus, the noun ta'ir (lit., \"a flying creature\" or \"a bird\") is often used in classical Arabic to denote \"destiny\" or \"fortune\", both good and evil, as in the next sentence of the above verse (\"their [evil] fortune had been decreed by [lit., \"was with\"] God\"). Instances of this tropical employment of the expressions ta'ir and tayr and their verbal derivations are also found in 3:49, 5:110, 17:13, 27:47, 36:18-19."
