  "en_tr_yusuf": "So if they dispute with thee, say: \"I have submitted My whole self to Allah and so have those who follow me.\" And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned: \"Do ye (also) submit yourselves?\" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah's sight are (all) His servants.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And if they argue with thee, (O Muhammad), say: I have surrendered my purpose to Allah and (so have) those who follow me. And say unto those who have received the Scripture and those who read not: Have ye (too) surrendered? If they surrender, then truly they are rightly guided, and if they turn away, then it is thy duty only to convey the message (unto them). Allah is Seer of (His) bondmen.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "But if they dispute with you, say: I have submitted myself entirely to Allah and (so) every one who follows me; and say to those who have been given the Book and the unlearned people: Do you submit yourselves? So if they submit then indeed they follow the right way; and if they turn back, then upon you is only the delivery of the message and Allah sees the servants.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "So if they dispute with you (Muhammad SAW) say: \"I have submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so have) those who follow me.\" And say to those who were given the Scripture (Jews and Christians) and to those who are illiterates (Arab pagans): \"Do you (also) submit yourselves (to Allah in Islam)?\" If they do, they are rightly guided; but if they turn away, your duty is only to convey the Message; and Allah is All- Seer of (His ) slaves.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Wherefore if they contend with thee, say thou: have surrendered myself unto Allah and he who followeth me. And say thou unto those who have been vouchsafed the Book and unto the illiterates; do you (also) accept Islam? Then if they accept Islam, they are of a surety guided; and if they turn away, then upon thee is only the preaching, and Allah is Beholder of His bondsmen.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "If they argue with you, say: 'I have submitted my face to Allah and so have those who follow me. ' To those who have received the Book (Jews and Nazarenes) and to the ignorant, ask: 'Have you submitted yourselves to Allah? ' If they became Muslims they were guided, if they turn away, then your only duty is to warn them. Allah is watching over all His worshipers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Now, if they dispute with thee, say, `I have submitted myself to God, and so have those who follow me .' And say to those who were given the Book and to unlettered folk, `have you submited?' If they have submited, they are guided; but if they turn back, then thine is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants.",
  "en_tr_sher": "But if they dispute with thee, say 'I have surrendered myself completely to God, and also those who follow me.' And say to those who have been given the Book and to the Unlearned, 'Have you also surrendered? If they surrender, then they will surely be rightly guided, but if they turn back, then thy duty is only to convey the Message. And God is Watchful of His servants.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Thus, [O Prophet,] if they argue with thee, say, \"I have surrendered my whole being unto God, and [so have] all who follow me!\" &ndash; and ask those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime, as well as all unlettered people, \"Have you [too] surrendered yourselves unto Him?\" \nAnd if they surrender themselves unto Him, they are on the right path; but if they turn away &ndash; behold, thy duty is no more than to deliver the message: for God sees all that is in [the hearts of] His creatures.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "So if they dispute with thee, say: I have surrendered my will to God, and whosoever follows me. And say to those who have been given the Book and to the common folk: Have you surrendered? If they have surrendered, they are right guided; but if they turn their backs, thine it is only to deliver the Message; and God sees His servants.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And if they remonstrate with you, tell them: 'I have submitted my whole being to Allah, and so have those who follow me.' And ask the People of the Book as well as those who follow no heavenly Scripture: 'Have you also submitted (to Allah)?'{{18}} If they have submitted to Him, they are indeed on the right way but if they deviate from submitting to Allah, then your duty is merely to deliver the message. Allah observes the affairs of His servants.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "So if they dispute with thee, say: \"I have submitted My whole self{{360}} to Allah and so have those who follow me.\" And say to the People of the Book and to those who are unlearned{{361}}: \"Do ye (also) submit yourselves?\" If they do, they are in right guidance, but if they turn back, Thy duty is to convey the Message; and in Allah's sight are (all) His servants{{362}}.",
  "en_ctr_asad": "Thus, [O Prophet,] if they argue with thee, say, \"I have surrendered my whole being unto God, and [so have] all who follow me!\" - and ask those who have been vouchsafed revelation aforetime, as well as all unlettered people,{{14}} \"Have you [too] surrendered yourselves unto Him?\" And if they surrender themselves unto Him, they are on the right path; but if they turn away - behold, thy duty is no more than to deliver the message: for God sees all that is in [the hearts of] His creatures.",

To them the appeal should be easy and intelligible, as all religion is one, and it is only being renewed in Islam.

A great many of both these classes did so. But the few who resisted Allah's grace, and actually threatened and persecuted those who believed, are told that Allah will look after His own."
