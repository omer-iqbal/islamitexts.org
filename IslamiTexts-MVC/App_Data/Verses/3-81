In the Old Testament as it now exists, Muhammad is foretold in Deut. 18:18; and the rise of the Arab nation in Isaiah 42:11, for Kedar was a son of Isma'il and the name is used for the Arab nation. Also, in the New Testament as it now exists, Muhammad is foretold in the Gospel of St. John, 14:16, 15:26, and 16:7; the future Comforter cannot be the \"Holy Spirit\" as understood by Christians, because the Holy Spirit already was present, helping and guiding Jesus. The Greek word translated \"Comforter\" is \"Paracletos\", which is an easy corruption from \"Periclytos\", which is almost a literal translation of \"Muhammad\" or \"Ahmad\"; see 7:157 and 61:6. Further, there were other Gospels that have perished, but of which traces still remain, which were even more specific in their reference to Muhammad; e.g., the Gospel of St. Barnabas, of which an Italian translation is extant in the State Library at Vienna. It was edited in 1907 with an English translation by Mr. Lonsdale and Laura Ragg."
