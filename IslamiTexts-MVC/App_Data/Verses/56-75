Tabari and Ibn Kathir, see also note 1 on 53:1). By \"calling to witness\" the gradual manner of its revelation, the Qur'an points implicitly to the astounding fact that it has remained free of all inconsistencies and inner contradictions (cf. 4:82 and the corresponding note 97) despite all the dramatic changes in the Prophet's life during the twenty-three years of the \"unfolding\" of the divine writ: and this explains, too, the subsequent parenthetic clause (verse 76)."
