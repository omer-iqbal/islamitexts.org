      "note": "The translators and Commentators nearly all understand taqumu in the sense of rising up from sleep. But the rendering I have given is consistent with Qur'anic usage. In 26:218, we have the same two words hina taqumu, meaning \"standing forth (in prayer)\". In 57:25, we have ti yaqumu al nas bil al qist, which obviously means \"that men may stand forth in Justice,\" i.e., do all their business injustice. In 78:38, we have yaqumu used for the angels standing forth in ranks. On my rendering the meaning will be: 'celebrate Allah's praises when you stand forth in prayer, or at all times when you go about your business; but also for part of the night and at early dawn when worldly life is at a standstill.'"
