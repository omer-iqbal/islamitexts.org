  "en_tr_shakir": "He said: Surely he has been unjust to you in demanding your ewe (to add) to his own ewes; and most surely most of the partners act wrongfully towards one another, save those who believe and do good, and very few are they; and Dawood was sure that We had tried him, so he sought the protection of his Lord and he fell down bowing and turned time after time (to Him).",
  "en_tr_hilali": "[Dawud (David)] said (immediately without listening to the opponent): \"He has wronged you in demanding your ewe in addition to his ewes.

  "en_tr_arberry": "Said he, Assuredly he has wronged thee in asking for thy ewe in addition to his sheep; and indeed many intermixers do injury one against the other, save those who believe, and do deeds of righteousness -- and how few they are!

Great though he was as a king, and just though he was as a judge, the moment that he thought of these things in self-pride, his merit vanished.
