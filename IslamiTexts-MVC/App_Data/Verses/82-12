However, another explanation has been suggested by me in my rendering of 50:16-23 and elaborated in the corresponding notes 11-16. In consonance with that interpretation, the \"watchful force\" (hafiz) set over every human being is his own conscience, which \"records\" all his motives and actions in his subconscious mind. Since it is the most precious element in man's psyche, it is described in verse 11 as \"noble\"."
