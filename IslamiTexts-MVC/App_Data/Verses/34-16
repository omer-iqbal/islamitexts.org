The feathery leaved tamarisk, which is only good for twigs and wattle-work, replaced the fragrant plants and flowers.

The lote tree belongs to the family Rhamnaceac, Zizyphus Spina Christi. of which (it is supposed) Christ's crown of thorns was made, allied to the Zizyphus Jujuba, or bertree of India. Wild, it is shrubby, thorny and useless. In cultivation it bears good fruit, and some shade, and can be thornless, thus becoming a symbol of heavenly bliss: 56:28."
