  "en_tr_yusuf": "When thou (O Messenger) art with them, and standest to lead them in prayer, Let one party of them stand up (in prayer) with thee, Taking their arms with them: When they finish their prostrations, let them Take their position in the rear. And let the other party come up which hath not yet prayed - and let them pray with thee, Taking all precaution, and bearing arms: the Unbelievers wish, if ye were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to assault you in a single rush. But there is no blame on you if ye put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because ye are ill; but take (every) precaution for yourselves. For the Unbelievers Allah hath prepared a humiliating punishment.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And when thou (O Muhammad) art among them and arrangest (their) worship for them, let only a party of them stand with thee (to worship) and let them take their arms. Then when they have performed their prostrations let them fall to the rear and let another party come that hath not worshipped and let them worship with thee, and let them take their precaution and their arms. Those who disbelieve long for you to neglect your arms and your baggage that they may attack you once for all. It is no sin for you to lay aside your arms, if rain impedeth you or ye are sick. But take your precaution. Lo! Allah prepareth for the disbelievers shameful punishment.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And when you are among them and keep up the prayer for them, let a party of them stand up with you, and let them take their arms; then when they have prostrated themselves let them go to your rear, and let another party who have not prayed come forward and pray with you, and let them take their precautions and their arms; (for) those who disbelieve desire that you may be careless of your arms and your luggage, so that they may then turn upon you with a sudden united attack, and there is no blame on you, if you are annoyed with rain or if you are sick, that you lay down your arms, and take your precautions; surely Allah has prepared a disgraceful chastisement for the unbelievers.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "When you (O Messenger Muhammad SAW) are among them, and lead them in As-Salat (the prayer), let one party of them stand up [in Salat (prayer)] with you taking their arms with them; when they finish their prostrations, let them take their positions in the rear and let the other party come up which has not yet prayed, and let them pray with you taking all the precautions and bearing arms. Those who disbelieve wish, if you were negligent of your arms and your baggage, to attack you in a single rush, but there is no sin on you if you put away your arms because of the inconvenience of rain or because you are ill, but take every precaution for yourselves. Verily, Allah has prepared a humiliating torment for the disbelievers.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And when thou art amidst them and hast set up the prayer for them, then let a party of them stand with thee and let them retain their arms; then when they have prostrated themselves, let them go behind you, and let anot her party who have not yet prayed, come and pray with thee; and let them also take their caution and their arms. Pain would those who disbelieve that ye neglected your arms and your baggage, so that they might swoop down upon you at one swoop. And there shall be no fault in you, if there be an injury to you from rain or ye are ailing, that ye lay down your arms and yet take your caution. Verily Allah hath gotten ready for the infidels a torment ignominious.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "When you are with them, and establish the prayer, let a party of them stand with you, and let them take their weapons. After making their prostrations, let them be behind you, and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with you, taking their precautions and their weapons. Those who disbelieve wish that you should be inattentive of your weapons and your baggage, so that they might swoop upon you with one assault. But there is no fault in you if you are harmed by rain, or you are sick to lay aside your weapons, but take your precautions. Allah has prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And when thou art amongst them, and thou conductest the Prayer for them, let a group of them stand with thee, and let them take their weapons; then, when they have prostrated themselves, let them be behind you, and let the other group, who have not prayed, come and pray with thee, and let them take their precautions and their weapons. The unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage, then they would wheal on you all at once. But there is no fault in you if you are hurt with rain, or you are sick, that you lay aside your weapons, but take your precautions; God has surely prepared a humiliating punishment for the unbelievers.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And when thou art among them, and leadest the Prayer for them, let a party of them stand with thee and let them take their arms. And when they have performed their prostrations, let them go to your rear, and let another party, who have not yet prayed, come forward and pray with thee, and let them take their means of defence and their arms. The disbelievers wish that you were neglectful of your arms and your baggage that they may fall upon you at once. And it shall be no sin for you, because of the inconvenience caused by rain or because you are sick, that you lay aside your arms. But you should always take your precautions. Surely, God has prepared an humiliating punishment for the disbelievers.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Thus, when thou art among the believers and about to lead them in prayer, let [only] part of them stand up with thee, retaining their arms. Then, after they have finished their prayer, let them provide you cover while another group, who have not yet prayed, shall come forward and pray with thee, being fully prepared against danger and retaining their arms: [for] those who are bent on denying the truth would love to see you oblivious of your arms and your equipment, so that they might fall upon you in a surprise attack. But it shall not be wrong for you to lay down your arms [while you pray] if you are troubled by rain or if you are ill; but [always] be fully prepared against danger. \nVerily, God has readied shameful suffering for all who deny the truth!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "When thou art amongst them, and performest for them the prayer, let a party of them stand with thee, and let them take their weapons. When they bow themselves, let them be behind you; and let another party who have not prayed come and pray with thee, taking their precautions and their weapons. The unbelievers wish that you should be heedless of your weapons and your baggage, then they would wheel on you all at once. There is no fault in you, if rain molests you, or you are sick, to lay aside your weapons; but take your precautions. God has prepared for the unbelievers a humbling chastisement.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "(O Messenger!) If you are among the believers and rise (in the state of war) to lead the Prayer for them,{{134}} let a party of them stand with you to worship, keeping their arms.{{135}} When they have performed their prostration, let them go behind you, and let another party who have not prayed, pray with you, remaining on guard and keeping their arms,{{136}} for the unbelievers love to see you heedless of your arms and your baggage so that they might swoop upon you in a surprise attack.
