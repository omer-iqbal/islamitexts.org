  "en_tr_yusuf": "And his people came rushing towards him, and they had been long in the habit of practising abominations. He said: \"O my people! Here are my daughters: they are purer for you (if ye marry)! Now fear Allah, and cover me not with shame about my guests! Is there not among you a single right-minded man?\"",

  "en_tr_ayubk": "And his people came rushing to him; and they have been committing evil deeds before. He said, `O my people, here are my daughters who are purer for you; so fear God and do not disgrace me in my guests. Is there not among you any right-mended man?'",

The Holy Qur'an nowhere suggests such abominations. Some Commentators suggest that \"my daughters\" in the mouth of a venerable man like Lut, the father of his people, may mean any young girls of those Towns. \"My son\" (waladi) is still a common mode of address in Arabic-speaking countries when an elderly man addresses a young man."
