For us, now, with the whole of the Qur'an before us, the injunction is specially necessary. The words of the Qur'an must not be read hastily, merely to get through so much reading. They must be studied, and their deep meaning pondered over. They are themselves so beautiful that they must be lovingly pronounced in tones of rhythmic music."

The term tartil primarily denotes \"the putting [of something] together distinctly, in a well-arranged manner, and without any haste\" (Jawhari, Baydawi; also Lisan al-'Arab, Qamus). When applied to the recitation of a text, it signifies a calm, measured utterance with thoughtful consideration of the meaning to be brought out. A somewhat different significance attaches to a variant of this phrase in 25:32, applying to the manner in which the Qur'an was revealed."
