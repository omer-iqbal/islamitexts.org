  "en_tr_yusuf": "Those who give partners (to Allah) will say: \"If Allah had wished, we should not have given partners to Him nor would our fathers; nor should we have had any taboos.\" So did their ancestors argue falsely, until they tasted of Our wrath.

  "en_tr_pickth": "They who are idolaters will say: Had Allah willed, we had not ascribed (unto Him) partners neither had our fathers, nor had we forbidden aught.

  "en_tr_dbadi": "Anon will those who associate had God willed, we would not say: have associated, nor our fathers; neither could we have forbidden aught. Even so  belied those before them, until they tasted Our wrath. Say thou: is there with you any authority,  that ye may bring unto us? ye but follow your fancy, and only conjecture.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "The idolaters will say: 'Had Allah willed, neither we nor our fathers would have associated (idols), nor would we have forbidden anything.

You follow nothing but guessing and you are only speakers of conjecture. '",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "The idolaters will say, `had God willed, we would not have been idolaters, nor our fathers, nor would have we forbidden anything;' so cried lies those before them until they tasted Our might.

  "en_tr_sher": "Those who associate gods with God will say, 'If God had pleased, we would not have associated gods with Him, nor would our fathers, nor would we have made anything unlawful.'

You only follow mere conjecture. And you only tell lies.'",
  "en_tr_asad": "THOSE who are bent on ascribing divinity to aught beside God will say, \"Had God so willed, we would not have ascribed divinity to aught but Him, nor would our forefathers [have done so]; and neither would we have declared as forbidden anything [that He has allowed].\" Even so did those who lived before them give the lie to the truth &ndash; until they came to taste Our punishment! \nSay: \"Have you any [certain] knowledge which you could proffer to us? You follow but [other people's] conjectures, and you yourselves do nothing but guess.\"",
  "en_tr_arberry": "The idolaters will say, Had God willed, we would not have been idolaters, neither our fathers, nor would we have forbidden aught.

  "en_tr_maududi": "Those who associate others with Allah in His divinity will now surely say: 'Had Allah willed, neither we nor our forefathers would have associated others with Allah in His divinity, nor would we have declared anything (which Allah did not forbid) as forbidden.'{{124}} Even so those who had lived before them gave the lie (to the Truth) until they tasted Our chastisement. Tell them: 'Have you any sure knowledge that you can produce before us? In fact you are only following idle fancies, merely conjecturing.'",
