  "en_tr_pickth": "Among the People of the Scripture there is he who, if thou trust him with a weight of treasure, will return it to thee. And among them there is he who, if thou trust him with a piece of gold, will not return it to thee unless thou keep standing over him. That is because they say: We have no duty to the Gentiles. They speak a lie concerning Allah knowingly.",

  "en_tr_hilali": "Among the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians) is he who, if entrusted with a Cantar (a great amount of wealth, etc.), will readily pay it back; and among them there is he who, if entrusted with a single silver coin, will not repay it unless you constantly stand demanding, because they say: \"There is no blame on us to betray and take the properties of the illiterates (Arabs).\" But they tell a lie against Allah while they know it.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And of the people of the Book is he whom if thou trustest with a talent, he will restore it unto thee, and among them is he whom if thou trustest with a dinar, he will not restore it unto thee except thou art ever standing over him that is because they say  there is in the matter of the illiterates no call on us.

  "en_tr_arberry": "And of the People of the Book is he who, if thou trust him with a hundredweight, will restore it thee; and of them is he who, if thou trust him with one pound, will not restore it thee, unless ever thou standest over him. That, because they say, There is no way over us as to the common people. They speak falsehood against God and that wittingly.",
