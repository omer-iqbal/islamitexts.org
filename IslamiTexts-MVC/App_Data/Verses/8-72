  "en_tr_yusuf": "Those who believed, and adopted exile, and fought for the Faith, with their property and their persons, in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave (them) asylum and aid,- these are (all) friends and protectors, one of another. As to those who believed but came not into exile, ye owe no duty of protection to them until they come into exile; but if they seek your aid in religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a people with whom ye have a treaty of mutual alliance. And (remember) Allah seeth all that ye do.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Lo! those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of Allah, and those who took them in and helped them: these are protecting friends one of another. And those who believed but did not leave their homes, ye have no duty to protect them till they leave their homes; but if they seek help from you in the matter of religion then it is your duty to help (them) except against a folk between whom and you there is a treaty. Allah is Seer of what ye do.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Surely those who believed and fled (their homes) and struggled hard in Allah's way with their property and their souls, and those who gave shelter and helped-- these are guardians of each other; and (as for) those who believed and did not fly, not yours is their guardianship until they fly; and if they seek aid from you in the matter of religion, aid is incumbent on you except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty, and Allah sees what you do.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Verily, those who believed, and emigrated and strove hard and fought with their property and their lives in the Cause of Allah as well as those who gave (them) asylum and help, - these are (all) allies to one another. And as to those who believed but did not emigrate (to you O Muhammad SAW), you owe no duty of protection to them until they emigrate, but if they seek your help in religion, it is your duty to help them except against a people with whom you have a treaty of mutual alliance, and Allah is the All- Seer of what you do.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Verily those who believed and emigrated and strave hard in the way of Allah with their riches and lives'and those who sheltered and succoured: those shall be heirs unto one anot her. And those who believed but emigrated not, ye have naught of inheritance to do with them, unless they emigrate. And should they seek succour from you in the matter of religion, then incumbent on you is the succour, except against a people between whom and you there is a compact. And Allah is the Beholder of that which ye work.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Those who believe and migrated, and fought for the Cause of Allah with their wealth and their persons; and those who sheltered them and helped them shall be guides to each other. And those who believe, but have not emigrated you have no guidance towards them till they emigrate. But if they seek your help in the cause of your religion, it is your duty to help them, except against a nation with whom you have a treaty. Allah sees the things you do.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Those who believed and emigrated and struggled with their wealth and their selves in the way of God, and those who gave shelter and helped, those are friends of one another. And those who believed but did not emigrate, you have no duty of friendship towards them at all until they emigrate; yet if they ask you for help in the matter of religion, help is (obligatory) upon you, except against a people between whom and you there is a treaty; and God sees the things you do.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Surely, those who believed and left their homes and strove with their wealth and their lives for the cause of God, and those who gave them shelter and help -- these are friends one of another. But as for those who believed but did not leave their homes, you are not at all responsible for their protection until they leave their homes. But if they seek your help in the matter of religion, then it is your duty to help them, except against a people between whom and yourselves there is a treaty. And God sees what you do.",
  "en_tr_asad": "BEHOLD, as for those who have attained to faith, and who have forsaken the domain of evil and are striving hard, with their possessions and their lives, in God's cause, as well as those who shelter and succour [them] &ndash; these are [truly] the friends and protectors of one another. \nBut as for those who have come to believe without having migrated [to your country] &ndash; you are in no wise responsible for their protection until such a time as they migrate [to you]. Yet, if they ask you for succour against religious persecution, it is your duty to give [them] this succour &ndash; except against a people between whom and yourselves there is a covenant: for God sees all that you do.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Those who believe, and have emigrated and struggled with their possessions and their selves in the way of God, and those who have given refuge and help -- those are friends one of another. And those who believe, but have not emigrated -- you have no duty of friendship towards them till they emigrate; yet if they ask you for help, for religions sake, it is your duty to help them, except against a people between whom and you there is a compact; and God sees the things you do.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Surely those who believed and migrated and strove hard in the way of Allah with their possessions and their lives, and those that sheltered and helped them - they alone are the true allies of one another. And those who believed but did not migrate (to Dar-al-Islam), you are under no obligation of alliance unless they migrate.{{50}} And should they seek help from you in the matter of religion, it is incumbent on you to provide help unless it be against a people with whom you have a pact.{{51}} Allah is cognizant of all that you do.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Those who believed, and adopted exile, and fought for the Faith, with their property and their persons, in the cause of Allah, as well as those who gave (them) asylum{{1239}} and aid,- these are (all) friends and protectors, one of another.

But if the weaker brethren are in a state in mutual alliance with the community, the community cannot in honour interfere with that state, whether it is Muslim or not.
