The Jewish excesses in the direction of formalism, racialism, exclusiveness, and rejection of Christ Jesus have been denounced in many places. Here the Christian attitude is condemned, which raises Jesus to an equality with Allah; in some cases venerates Mary almost to idolatry; attributes a physical son to Allah; and invents the doctrine of the Trinity, opposed to all reason, which according to the Athanasian Creed, unless a man believes, he is doomed to hell forever. Let our Muslims also beware lest they fall into excesses either in doctrine or in formalism, (Cf. 11:110)."

As regards the expression, \"a soul from Him\" or \"created by Him\", it is to be noted that among the various meanings which the word ruh bears in the Qur'an (e.g., \"inspiration\" in 2:87 and 253), it is also used in its primary significance of \"breath of life\", \"soul\", or \"spirit\": thus, for instance, in 32:9, where the ever-recurring evolution of the human embryo is spoken of: \"and then He forms him [i.e., man] and breathes into him of His spirit\" - that is, endows him with a conscious soul which represents God's supreme gift to man and is, therefore, described as \"a breath of His spirit\". In the verse under discussion, which stresses the purely human nature of Jesus and refutes the belief in his divinity, the Qur'an points out that Jesus, like all other human beings, was \"a soul created by Him\"."
