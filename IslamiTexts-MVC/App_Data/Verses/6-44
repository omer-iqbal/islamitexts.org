There is a shallower stage, at which prosperity and the good things of life may teach us sympathy and goodness and cheerfulness like that of Mr. Cheeribyles in Dickens.

They go deeper and deeper into sin, until they are pulled up of a sudden and then instead of being contrite they merely become desperate."
