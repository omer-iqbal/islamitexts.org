  "en_tr_sher": "And when waves engulf them like so many coverings, they call upon God, in full sincerity of faith; but when He brings them to safe land, then some of them keep to the right course. And none denies Our Signs save every perfidious, ungrateful person.",
  "en_tr_asad": "For [thus it is with most men:] when the waves engulf them like shadows [of death], they call unto God, sincere [at that moment] in their faith in Him alone: but as soon as He has brought them safe ashore, some of them stop half-way [between belief and unbelief]. \nYet none could knowingly reject Our messages unless he be utterly perfidious, ingrate.",

Unlike the people mentioned in the last verse, who constantly seek Allah's help and give thanks for His mercies by using them aright and doing their duty, there is a class of men whose worship is merely inspired by terror.
