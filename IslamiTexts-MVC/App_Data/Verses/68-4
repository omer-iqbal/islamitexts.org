      "note": "The term khuluq, rendered by me as \"way of life\", describes a person's \"character\", \"innate disposition\" or \"nature\" in the widest sense of these concepts, as well as \"habitual behaviour\" which becomes, as it were, one's \"second nature\" (Taj al-'Arus). My identification of khuluq with \"way of life\" is based on the explanation of the above verse by Abd Allah ibn Abbas (as quoted by Tabari), stating that this term is here synonymous with din: and we must remember that one of the primary significances of the latter term is \"a way [or \"manner\"] of behaviour\" or \"of acting\" (Qamus). More over, we have several well-authenticated Traditions according to which Muhammad's widow A'ishah, speaking of the Prophet many years after his death, repeatedly stressed that \"his way of life (khuluq) was the Qur'an.\" (Muslim, Tabari and Hakim, on the authority of Said ibn Hisham; Ibn Hanbal, Abu Da'ud and Nasa'i, on the authority of Al-Hasan al-Basri; Tabari, on the authority of Qatadah and Jubayr ibn Nufayl; and several other compilations)."
