  "en_tr_yusuf": "Had We sent this as a Qur'an (in the language) other than Arabic, they would have said: \"Why are not its verses explained in detail? What! (a Book) not in Arabic and (a Messenger an Arab?\" Say: \"It is a Guide and a Healing to those who believe; and for those who believe not, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness in their (eyes): They are (as it were) being called from a place far distant!\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And if We had appointed it a Lecture in a foreign tongue they would assuredly have said: If only its verses were expounded (so that we might understand)? What! A foreign tongue and an Arab? - Say unto them (O Muhammad): For those who believe it is a guidance and a healing; and as for those who disbelieve, there is a deafness in their ears, and it is blindness for them. Such are called to from afar.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And if We had made it a Quran in a foreign tongue, they would certainly have said: Why have not its communications been made clear? What! a foreign (tongue) and an Arabian! Say: It is to those who believe a guidance and a healing; and (as for) those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears and it is obscure to them; these shall be called to from a far-off place.",

(A Book) not in Arabic and (the Messenger) an Arab?\" Say: \"It is for those who believe, a guide and a healing. And as for those who disbelieve, there is heaviness (deafness) in their ears, and it (the Qur'an) is blindness for them. They are those who are called from a place far away (so they neither listen nor understand).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And had We made it a recital in a foreign tongue, they would have surely said: wherefore are the verses thereof not detailed?  A foreign tongue and an Arab! Say thou: Unto those who have believed it is a guidance and a healing: and those who believe not, - in their ears there is a heaviness, and Unto them it is blindness. These are they who are cried Unto from a place far-off.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Had We made the Koran in a nonArabic (language) they would have said: 'If only its verses were distinguished! Why in (a) nonArabic (language, when theProphet is) an Arab? ' Say: 'To the believers it is a guidance and a healing. But to those who do not believe, there is a heaviness in their ears, to them it is blindness. They are those called from afar. '",

Why &ndash; [a message in] a non-Arabic tongue, and [its bearer] an Arab?\" \nSay: \"Unto all who have attained to faith, this [divine writ] is a guidance and a source of health; but as for those who will not believe &ndash; in their ears is deafness, and so it remains obscure to them: they are [like people who are] being called from too far away.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "If We had made it a barbarous Koran, they would have said, Why are its signs not distinguished? What, barbarous and Arabic? Say: To the believers it is a guidance, and a healing; but those who believe not, in their ears is a heaviness, and to them it is a blindness; those -- they are called from a far place.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Had We revealed this as a non-Arabic Qur'an they would have said: \"Why were its verses not clearly expounded? How strange, a non-Arabic scripture and an Arab audience!\"{{54}} Tell them: \"It is a guidance and a healing to the believers. But to those who do not believe, it serves as a plug in their ears and a covering over their eyes. It is as if they are being called from a place far away.{{55}}",
