      "note": "Burnt sacrifices figured in the Mosaic Law, and in the religious ceremonies long before Moses, but it is not true that the Mosaic Law laid down a fire from heavens on a burnt sacrifice as a test of the credentials of Prophets. Even if it had been so, did the Jews obey the Prophets who showed this Sign? In Leviticus 9:23- 24. we are told a burnt offering prepared by Moses and Aaron: \"and there came a fire out from before the Lord, and consumed upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat.\" Yet the people rebelled frequently against Moses, and rebellion against a Prophet is spiritually an attempt to kill him. Abel's offering (sacrifice) was probably a burnt offering: it was accepted by Allah, and he was killed by Cain out of jealousy: Gen. 4:3-8. Mosaic sacrifices were no longer needed by the people of Jesus or the people of Muhammad."
