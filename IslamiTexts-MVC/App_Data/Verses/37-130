According to Tabari, Abd Allah ibn Mas'ud used to read this verse as \"Peace be upon Idrasin\", which, apart from giving us a variant or a plural of Idris (\"Idris and his followers\"), lends support to the view that Idris and Ilyas are but two designations of one and the same person, the Biblical Elijah.
