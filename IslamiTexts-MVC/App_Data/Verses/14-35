Notice the four divisions into which it falls: (1) verses 35-36 are spoken by Abraham on his own behalf (\"O my Lord!\"); (2) verse 37-38 are spoken on behalf of his progeny (\"O our Lord!\") but with special reference to the elder branch, the children of Isma'il; (3) verses 39-40 are again a personal appeal, but both branches of his family, viz., the sons of Isma'il and Isaac, are expressly mentioned; (4) verse 41 is a Prayer for himself, his parents, and all Believers, typifying that in the universality of Islam all nations are to be blessed. Jerusalem, for the Mosaic Law and the Gospel of Jesus, was the centre and symbol for the Jews, though of course all Allah's Truth is universal; Makkah, the centre of the Arabs, was to throw off its tribal character and become universal in spite of the Makkans themselves."
