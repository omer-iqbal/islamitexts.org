This passage illustrates the supreme realism of the Qur'an, which takes into account human nature as it is, with all its God-willed complexity and its inner contradictions, and does not, therefore, postulate a priori an impossible ideal as a norm of human behaviour, (Cf. 91:8, which speaks of man's personality as \"imbued with moral failings as well as consciousness of God\" - a phrase which is explained in the corresponding note 6.)"
