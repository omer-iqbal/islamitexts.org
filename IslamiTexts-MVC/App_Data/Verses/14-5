However, in view of the frequent Qur'anic application of the word \"day\" to eschatological concepts - e.g., the \"Last Day\", the \"Day of Resurrection\", the \"Day of Reckoning\", and so forth - and, particularly, in view of 45:14, where the expression \"the Days of God\" unmistakably points to His judgment at the end of time - it is only logical to assume that in the present context this expression bears the same significance: namely, God's final judgment of man on the Day of Resurrection. The use of the plural form (\"the Days of God\") is perhaps meant to bring out the idea that the \"Day\" of which the Qur'an so often speaks has nothing to do with human time-definitions but, rather, alludes to an ultimate reality in which the concept of \"time\" has neither place nor meaning."
