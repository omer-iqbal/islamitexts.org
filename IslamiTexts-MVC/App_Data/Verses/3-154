  "en_tr_yusuf": "After (the excitement) of the distress, He sent down calm on a band of you overcome with slumber, while another band was stirred to anxiety by their own feelings, Moved by wrong suspicions of Allah-suspicions due to ignorance. They said: \"What affair is this of ours?\" Say thou: \"Indeed, this affair is wholly Allah's.\" They hide in their minds what they dare not reveal to thee. They say (to themselves): \"If we had had anything to do with this affair, We should not have been in the slaughter here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death\"; but (all this was) that Allah might test what is in your breasts and purge what is in your hearts. For Allah knoweth well the secrets of your hearts.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Then, after grief, He sent down security for you. As slumber did it overcome a party of you, while (the other) party, who were anxious on their own account, thought wrongly of Allah, the thought of ignorance. They said: Have we any part in the cause? Say (O Muhammad): The cause belongeth wholly to Allah. They hide within themselves (a thought) which they reveal not unto thee, saying: Had we had any part in the cause we should not have been slain here. Say: Even though ye had been in your houses, those appointed to be slain would have gone forth to the places where they were to lie. (All this hath been) in order that Allah might try what is in your breasts and prove what is in your hearts. Allah is Aware of what is hidden in the breasts (of men).",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Then after sorrow He sent down security upon you, a calm coming upon a party of you, and (there was) another party whom their own souls had rendered anxious; they entertained about Allah thoughts of ignorance quite unjustly, saying: We have no hand in the affair. Say: Surely the affair is wholly (in the hands) of Allah. They conceal within their souls what they would not reveal to you. They say: Had we any hand in the affair, we would not have been slain here. Say: Had you remained in your houses, those for whom slaughter was ordained would certainly have gone forth to the places where they would be slain, and that Allah might test what was in your breasts and that He might purge what was in your hearts; and Allah knows what is in the breasts.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Then after the distress, He sent down security for you. Slumber overtook a party of you, while another party was thinking about themselves (as how to save their ownselves, ignoring the others and the Prophet SAW) and thought wrongly of Allah - the thought of ignorance. They said, \"Have we any part in the affair?\" Say you (O Muhammad SAW): \"Indeed the affair belongs wholly to Allah.\" They hide within themselves what they dare not reveal to you, saying: \"If we had anything to do with the affair, none of us would have been killed here.\" Say: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those for whom death was decreed would certainly have gone forth to the place of their death,\" but that Allah might test what is in your breasts; and to Mahis that which was in your hearts (sins), and Allah is All-Knower of what is in (your) breasts.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Then, after sorrow, He sent down unto you a security--slumber coming over a section of you; While anot her section, concerned about themselves, bethought of Allah unjustly: the thought of paganism. They said: have we aught at all of the affair? Say thou: the affair is wholly Allah's. They hide within themselves that which they disclose not unto thee, saying:  had we aught of the affair, we would not have been slain here. Say thou: had ye stayed in your houses, even then those decreed to be slain would surely have gone forth to their places of slaughter; and this happened in order that he might prove that which was in your breasts, and purge that which was in your hearts; and Allah is Knower of that which is in the breasts.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Then, after sorrow, He sent down upon you safety. Slumber overtook a party, while another party cared only for themselves, thinking of Allah thoughts that were not true, the guess of ignorance, saying: 'Have we any say in the affair? ' Say: 'The entire affair belongs to Allah. ' They conceal in themselves what they do not disclose to you. They say: 'If we had any say in the affair we should not have been killed here. ' Say: 'Had you stayed in your homes, those of you for whom slaying was written would have come out to their (death) beds so that Allah might try what was in your chests and that He will examine what is in your hearts. ' And Allah knows the innermost of the chests.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Then after sorrow, He sent down upon you, security __ a slumber overcoming a group of you; and a group was anxious on their own account, thinking of God other than the truth, the thoughts of (days of) ignorance, saying, `have we any part in the affair?' Say, `the affair belongs entirely to God.' They were concealing in their hearts that they were not showing to thee. They were saying, `if we had any part in the affair, we would not have been killed here.' Say , `even if you had been in your houses, those for whom killing was prescribed, would have gone forth to their last couches; and it was so, that God might try what was in your breasts, and that He might purify what was in your hearts; and God knows the thoughts in the breasts.'",
  "en_tr_sher": "Then after the sorrow He sent down peace on you -- a slumber that overcame a party of you -- while the other part was anxious concerning their ownselves. They entertain about God wrong thoughts of ignorance. They said, 'Have we any part in the affair?' Say, 'Verily the affair wholly belongs to God.' They hide in their minds what they disclose not to thee. They say, 'If we had any part in the determination of the affairs, we should not have been killed here.' Say, 'If you had remained in your homes, surely those on whom fighting had been enjoined would have gone forth to their death-beds that God might fulfill His decree and that He might test what is in your breasts and that He might purge what was in your hearts. And God knows well what is in your breasts;",
  "en_tr_asad": "Then, after this woe, He sent down upon you a sense of security, an inner calm which enfolded some of you, whereas the others, who cared mainly for themselves, entertained wrong thoughts about God &ndash; thoughts of pagan ignorance &ndash; saying, \"Did we, then, have any power of decision [in this matter]?\" \nSay: \"Verily, all power of decision does rest with God\" &ndash; [but as for them,] they are trying to conceal within themselves that [weakness of faith] which they would not reveal unto thee, [O Prophet, by] saying, \"If we had any power of decision, we would not have left so many dead behind.\"\nSay [unto them]: \"Even if you had remained in your homes, those [of you] whose death had been ordained would indeed have gone forth to the places where they were destined to lie down.\"\nAnd [all this befell you] so that God might put to a test all that you harbour in your bosoms, and render your innermost hearts pure of all dross: for God is aware of what is in the hearts [of men].",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Then He sent down upon you, after grief, security -- a slumber overcoming a party of you; and a party themselves had grieved, thinking of God thoughts that were not true such as the pagans thought, saying, Have we any part whatever in the affair? Say: The affair belongs to God entirely. They were concealing in their hearts that they show not to thee, saying, Ah, if we had had a part in the affair, never would we have been slain here. Say: Even if you had been in your houses, those for whom slaying was appointed would have sallied forth unto their last couches; and that God might try what was in your breasts, and that He might prove what was in your hearts; and God knows the thoughts in the breasts.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Then, after inflicting this grief, He sent down an inner peace upon you - a sleep which overtook some of you.{{112}} Those who were concerned merely about themselves, entertaining false notions about Allah - the notions of the Age of Ignorance - asked: 'Have we any say in the matter?' Tell them: 'Truly, all power of decision rests solely with Allah.' Indeed, they conceal in their hearts what they would not reveal to you, saying: 'If we had any power of decision, we would not have been slain here.' Say: 'Even if you had been in your houses, those for whom slaying had been appointed would have gone forth to the places where they were to be slain.' And all this happened so that Allah might test your secret thoughts and purge your hearts of all impurities. Allah knows well what is in the breasts of men.",
