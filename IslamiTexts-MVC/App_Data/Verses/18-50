  "en_tr_yusuf": "Behold! We said to the angels, \"Bow down to Adam\": They bowed down except Iblis. He was one of the Jinns, and he broke the Command of his Lord. Will ye then take him and his progeny as protectors rather than Me? And they are enemies to you! Evil would be the exchange for the wrong-doers!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And (remember) when We said unto the angels: Fall prostrate before Adam, and they fell prostrate, all save Iblis. He was of the jinn, so he rebelled against his Lord's command. Will ye choose him and his seed for your protecting friends instead of Me, when they are an enemy unto you? Calamitous is the exchange for evil-doers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And when We said to the angels: Make obeisance to Adam; they made obeisance but Iblis (did it not). He was of the jinn, so he transgressed the commandment of his Lord. What! would you then take him and his offspring for friends rather than Me, and they are your enemies? Evil is (this) change for the unjust.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And (remember) when We said to the angels;\"Prostrate to Adam.\" So they prostrated except Iblis (Satan). He was one of the jinns; he disobeyed the Command of his Lord. Will you then take him (Iblis) and his offspring as protectors and helpers rather than Me while they are enemies to you? What an evil is the exchange for the Zalimun (polytheists, and wrong-doers, etc).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And recall what time we said unto the angels: prostrate yourselves before Adam, and they prostrated themselves, but Iblis did not; he was of the genii; so he trespassed the commandment of his Lord. Would ye then take him and his progeny as patrons instead of Me, whereas they are unto you an enemy III is for the wrong-doers an exchange!",
  "en_tr_qarib": "When We said to the angels: 'Prostrate yourselves before Adam, ' all prostrated themselves except iblis, who was one of the jinn, disobedient to the command of his Lord. Would you then take him and his descendants to be your guardians, other than Me, when they are your clear enemy? How evil is the exchange for the harmdoers!",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And when We said to the angels, `prostrate yourselves before Adam', they prostrated themselves, except Iblis; he was of the jinn, so he transgressed his Lord's command. Now, do you take him and his offspring as friends, apart from Me, while they are an enemy to you; how evil is that exchange for the wrong-doers!",
  "en_tr_sher": "And call to mind the time when We said to the angels, 'Submit to Adam,' and they all submitted but Iblis did not. He was one of the jinn; and he disobeyed the command of his Lord. Will you than take him and his offspring for friends instead of Me while they are your enemies? Evil is the exchange for the wrongdoers.",

Will you, then, take him and his cohorts for [your] masters instead of Me, although they are your foes? How vile an exchange on the evildoers' part!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And when We said to the angels, Bow yourselves to Adam; so they bowed themselves, save Iblis; he was one of the jinn, and committed ungodliness against his Lords command. What, and do you take him and his seed to be your friends, apart from Me, and they an enemy to you? How evil is that exchange for the evildoers!",
