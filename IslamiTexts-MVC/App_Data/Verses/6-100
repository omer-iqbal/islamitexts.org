      "note": "Jinns: who are they? In 18:50 we are told that Iblis was one of the Jinns, and it is suggested that that was why he disobeyed the Command of Allah. But in that passage and other similar passages, we are told that Allah commanded the angels to bow down to Adam, and they obeyed except Iblis. That implies that Iblis had been of the company of angels. In many passages Jinns and men are spoken of together. In 55:14-15, man is stated to have been created from clay, while Jinns from a flame of fire. The root meaning of junna, yujannu, is \"to be covered or hidden,\" and janna yajunnu, in the active voice, \"to cover or hide,\" as in 6:76- Some people say that jinn therefore means the hidden qualities or capacities in man; others that it means wild or jungle folk hidden in the hills or forests. I do not wish to be dogmatic, but I think, from a collation and study of the Quranic passages, that the meaning is simply \"a spirit,\" or an invisible or hidden force. In folklore stories and romances like the Arabian Nights they become personified into fantastic forms, but with them we are not concerned here. Both the Qur'an and the Hadith describe the Jinn as a definite species of living beings. They are created out of fire and are like man, may believe or disbelieve, accept or reject guidance. The authoritative Islamic texts show that they are not merely a hidden force, or a spirit. They are personalized beings who enjoy a certain amount of free will and thus will be called to account.

According to Arab philologists, the term jinn signifies, primarily, \"beings that are concealed from [man's] senses\" (Qamus, Lisan al-'Arab, Raghib), and is thus applicable to all kinds of invisible beings or forces.

The very concept of \"definition\" implies the possibility of a comparison or correlation of an object with other objects; God, however, is unique, there being \"nothing like unto Him\" (42:11) and, therefore, \"nothing that could be compared with Him\" (112:4) - with the result that any attempt at defining Him or His \"attributes\" is a logical impossibility and, from the ethical point of view, a sin. The fact that He is undefinable makes it clear that the \"attributes\" (sifat) of God mentioned in the Qur'an do not circumscribe His reality but, rather, the perceptible effect of His activity on and within the universe created by Him."
