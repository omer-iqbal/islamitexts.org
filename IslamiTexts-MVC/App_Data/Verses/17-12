  "en_tr_yusuf": "We have made the Night and the Day as two (of Our) Signs: the Sign of the Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the number and count of the years: all things have We explained in detail.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And We appoint the night and the day two portents. Then We make dark the portent of the night, and We make the portent of the day sight-giving, that ye may seek bounty from your Lord, and that ye may know the computation of the years, and the reckoning; and everything have We expounded with a clear expounding.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And We have made the night and the day two signs, then We have made the sign of the night to pass away and We have made the sign of the day manifest, so that you may seek grace from your Lord, and that you might know the numbering of years and the reckoning; and We have explained everything with distinctness.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And We have appointed the night and the day as two Ayat (signs etc.). Then, We have made dark the sign of the night while We have made the sign of day illuminating, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning. And We have explained everything (in detail) with full explanation.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And We have appointed the night and the day as two signs; then We blurred the sign of the night and made the sign of the day illuminating that ye may seek grace from Your Lord, and that ye may know the number of the years and the reckoning; and everything We have detailed in full details.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "We appointed the night and the day as two signs. Then, We blotted out the sign of the night and made the sign of the day to see, so that you seek the bounty of your Lord and that you know the number of years and the reckoning. And We have clearly distinguished everything.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And We have made the night and the day as two Signs, then We blotted out the Sign of the night and made the Sign of the day to show things, that you may seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the number of the years and the reckoning; and everything We have distinguished distinctly.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And We have made the night and the day two Signs, and the Sign of the night We have made dark, and the Sign of the day We have made sight-giving, that you make seek bounty from your Lord, and that you may know the computation of years and the process of reckoning. And everything We have explained with a detailed explanation.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And We have established the night and the day as two symbols; and thereupon We have effaced the symbol of night and set up [in its place] the light-giving symbol of day, so that you might seek to obtain your Sustainer's bounty and be aware of the passing years and of the reckoning [that is bound to come]. For clearly, most clearly, have We spelt out everything!",

  "en_tr_maududi": "We have made night and day as two signs. We made the sign of the night devoid of light, and made the sign of the day radiant that you may seek the bounty of your Lord and know the computation of years and numbers. Thus We have expounded everything in detail to keep everything distinct from the other.{{13}}",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "We have made the Night and the Day two{{2185}} (of Our) Signs: the Sign of the Night have We obscured, while the Sign of the Day We have made to enlighten you; that ye may seek bounty from your Lord,{{2186}} and that ye may know the number and count of the years: all things have We explained in detail.",

And this physical gift of Allah is good for us in two ways; (1) we can arrange for our livelihood, or we can attain knowledge of the physical sciences and gain some control over the physical forces of nature; and (2) the daily rising and setting of the sun gives us the computation of days and years, for the physical natural year is the solar year. But there is spiritual light even more precious: by it we can similarly attain two objects, viz. (1) our spiritual livelihood and knowledge, and (2) our computation of the stages we reach in our spiritual years. Let us be patient and seek everything as from Allah-in joy and in sorrow, in knowledge and in want of knowledge of those things which are above us. Let us rejoice in what Allah has given us, and not be impatient about those things which He in His wisdom has thought fit to withhold from us. But all things should be sought and striven for under the guidance of the All-Knowing Allah."
