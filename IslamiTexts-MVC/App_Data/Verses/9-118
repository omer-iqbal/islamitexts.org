  "en_tr_yusuf": "(He turned in mercy also) to the three who were left behind; (they felt guilty) to such a degree that the earth seemed constrained to them, for all its spaciousness, and their (very) souls seemed straitened to them,- and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah (and no refuge) but to Himself. Then He turned to them, that they might repent: for Allah is Oft-Returning, Most Merciful.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And to the three also (did He turn in mercy) who were left behind, when the earth, vast as it is, was straitened for them, and their own souls were straitened for them till they bethought them that there is no refuge from Allah save toward Him. Then turned He unto them in mercy that they (too) might turn (repentant unto Him). Lo! Allah! He is the Relenting, the Merciful.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And to the three who were left behind, until the earth became strait to them notwithstanding its spaciousness and their souls were also straitened to them; and they knew it for certain that there was no refuge from Allah but in Him; then He turned to them (mercifully) that they might turn (to Him); surely Allah is the Oft-returning (to mercy), the Merciful.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And (He did forgive also) the three [who did not join the Tabuk expedition (whom the Prophet SAW)] left (i.e. he did not give his judgement in their case, and their case was suspended for Allah's Decision) till for them the earth, vast as it is, was straitened and their ownselves were straitened to them, and they perceived that there is no fleeing from Allah, and no refuge but with Him. Then, He accepted their repentance, that they might repent (unto Him). Verily, Allah is the One Who accepts repentance, Most Merciful.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And also He relented toward the three who were left behind until when the earth, vast as it is, became straitened unto them and their own lives became straitened unto them and they imagined that there was no refuge from Allah except unto Him. Thereafter He relented toward them, so that they might repent. Verily Allah! He is the Relenting, the Merciful.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "And to the three who were left behind (at the Battle of Tabuk), until the earth became narrow with all its vastness, and their souls became narrow for them, they knew there was no shelter from Allah except in Him. Then He turned to them (in mercy) so that they might also turn (in repentance). Allah is the Turner, the Most Merciful.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "and (He turned) also to the three who remained behind, until, when the earth, despite its vastness, narrowed on them, and their selves also narrowed on them, and they thought that there was no refuge from God except in Him, then He turned towards them, that they may also turn; surely it is God who is the All - turning, the Merciful.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And He has turned with mercy to the three who happened to be left behind until when the earth became too strait for them with all its vastness, and their souls were also straitened for them, and they became convinced that there was no refuge from God save unto Himself, then He turned to them with mercy that they might turn to Him. Surely it is God who is Oft-Returning with compassion and is Merciful.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And [He turned in His mercy, too,] towards the three [groups of believers] who had fallen prey to corruption, until in the end &ndash; after the earth, despite all its vastness, had become [too] narrow for them and their souls had become [utterly] constricted &ndash; they came to know with certainty that there is no refuge from God other than [a return] unto Him; and thereupon He turned again unto them in His mercy, so that they might repent: for, verily, God alone is an acceptor of repentance, a dispenser of grace.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And to the three who were left behind, until, when the earth became strait for them, for all its breadth, and their souls became strait for them, and they thought that there was no shelter from God except in Him, then He turned towards them, that they might also turn; surely God turns, and is All-compassionate.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And Allah has forgiven the Three whose case had been put off.{{118}} When the earth with all its vastness seemed to have become narrow for them, and their own souls were a burden on them, and they realized that there was no refuge for them except in the mercy of Allah Himself, Allah turned to them with kindness so that they should turn to Him. Surely, He is Forgiving and Compassionate.{{119}}",

Next came a few who wavered because their will was weak and they were daunted by the dangers and difficulties that faced them; Allah's saving grace protected them and they conquered their weakness, and did not fail in their duty; Allah forgave them and accepted their repentance. Lastly, in the illustration taken from the Tabuk affair, there were some who actually failed in their duty, not from contumacy or ill will, but from thoughdessness, slackness, and human weakness: they actually failed to obey the Holy Prophet's summons, and were naturally called on to explain, and were excluded from the life of the Community. Their mental state is here described graphically. Though the earth is spacious, to them it was constrained. In their own souls they had a feeling of constraint. In worldly affluence they felt poor in spirit. They realised that they could not flee from Allah, but could only find solace and refuge in coming back to Him. They freely repented and showed it in their deeds, and Allah freely forgave them and took them to His grace. Though illustrated by the particular examples of the Ansar, viz., Ka'b, Mararah, and Hilal, the lesson is perfectly general and is good for all times."

      "note": "Or: \"had been left behind\", i.e., at the time of the expedition to Tabuk. My rendering of alladhina khullifu as \"those who had fallen prey to corruption\" is based on the tropical meaning of the verb khalufa or khullifa, \"he was [or \"became\"] altered [for the worse]\", or \"he became corrupt\" in the moral sense (see Asas, Nihayah, Lisan al-Arab, Qamas, Taj al-'Arus). This interpretation of alladhina khullifu - applying, in the above context, to those who remained behind under false pretences - has the support of some of the most outstanding Arab philologists, e.g., Abd al-Malik al-Asma'i (as quoted by Razi in his commentary on verse 83 of this surah). - As regards \"the three who had fallen prey to corruption\", the clasical commentators assume that it is a reference to three persons - namely, Ka'b ibn Malik, Mararah ibn ar-Rabi' and Hilal ibn Umayyah (all of them from among the ansar) - who abstained from the campaign and were thereafter ostracized by the Prophet and his Companions until the revelation of the above verse. But while it is historically established that these three Companions were indeed among the believers who thus failed in their duty (the relevant Traditions will be found in extenso in Tabari's and Ibn Kathir's commentaries on this verse), it seems to me that the context does not warrant such a restriction of its meaning to three particular persons, and that by \"the three\" are meant three groups of erring believers; (1) those who had advanced equivocal excuses and were thereupon permitted by the Prophet to remain at home (as has been alluded to in verses 43-46 as well as in the first sentence of verse 90); (2) those who absented themselves without permission, but afterwards spontaneously repented their sin (verses 102-105); and (3) those whose cases were at first \"deferred\" (verse 106), and who repented shortly after the Prophet's return from Tabuk (at which time verse 118 was revealed)."
