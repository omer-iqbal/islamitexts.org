They were both just men and prophets of Allah. The Bible, as we have it, is inconsistent: on the one hand it calls David \"a man after God's own heart\" (I Samuel, 13:14and Acts 13:22); and the Christians acclaim Christ as a son of David; but on the other hand, horrible crimes are ascribed to him, which, if he had committed them, would make him a monster of cruelty and injustice. About Solomon, too, while he is described as a glorious king, there are stories of his lapses into sin and idolatry. The Muslim teaching considers them both to be men of piety and wisdom, and high in spiritual knowledge."
