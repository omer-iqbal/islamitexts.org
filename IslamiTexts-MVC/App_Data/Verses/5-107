  "en_tr_yusuf": "But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury), let two others stand forth in their places,- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right: let them swear by Allah: \"We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed (beyond the truth): if we did, behold! the wrong be upon us!\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "But then, if it is afterwards ascertained that both of them merit (the suspicion of) sin, let two others take their place of those nearly concerned, and let them swear by Allah, (saying): Verily our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed (the bounds of duty), for them indeed we should be of the evil-doers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Then if it becomes known that they both have been guilty of a sin, two others shall stand up in their place from among those who have a claim against them, the two nearest in kin; so they two should swear by Allah: Certainly our testimony is truer than the testimony of those two, and we have not exceeded the limit, for then most surely we should be of the unjust.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "If then it gets known that these two had been guilty of sin, let two others stand forth in their places, nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right. Let them swear by Allah (saying): \"We affirm that our testimony is truer than that of both of them, and that we have not trespassed (the truth), for then indeed we should be of the wrong-doers.\"",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "If then it be lit upon that the twain had been guilty of a sin, then two othershall take their place from among those who were sinned against, the two nearest of kin, and they shall swear by Allah affirming: our testimony is worthier of credit than their testimony and we have not trespassed, for then verily we shall be of the wrong-doers.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "But if it is discovered that both of them have been subject to sinning, then two others shall stand in their place, these being the nearest of those most concerned, and they shall swear by Allah: 'Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, because then we would surely be among the harmdoers. '",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Then, if it is discovered that they have merited sin, two others shall stand in their place, being the nearest of those concerned, and they shall swear by God, `our testimony is truer than their testimony and we have not transgressed, for then we would surely be among the wrong-doers.'",
  "en_tr_sher": "But if it be discovered that the two witnesses are guilty of sin, then two others shall take their place from amongst those against whom the former two witnesses -- who were in a better position to give true evidence -- had deposed, and the two latter witnesses shall swear by God, saying, 'Surely our testimony is truer than the testimony of the former two, and we have not been unfair in any way; for then, indeed, we should be of the unjust.'",
  "en_tr_asad": "But if afterwards it should come to light that the two [witnesses] have become guilty of [this very] sin, then two others &ndash; from among those whom the two former have deprived of their right &ndash; shall take their place and shall swear by God, \"Our testimony is indeed truer than the testimony of these two, and we have not transgressed the bounds of what is right &ndash; or else, may we indeed be counted among the evildoers!\"",
  "en_tr_arberry": "But if it be discovered that both of them have merited the accusation of any sin, then two others shall stand in their place, these being the nearest of those most concerned, and they shall swear by God, Our testimony is truer than their testimony, and we have not transgressed, for then we would assuredly be among the evildoers.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Then if it is discovered later that the two are guilty of such sin, then two others shall stand in their place from among those against whom the two had sinfully deposed, and swear by Allah: 'Our testimony is truer than the testimony of the other two, and we have not transgressed in our statement; for then indeed we would become wrong-doers.'",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "But if it gets known that these two were guilty of the sin (of perjury), let two others stand forth in their places,- nearest in kin from among those who claim a lawful right:{{813}} let them swear by Allah. \"We affirm that our witness is truer than that of those two, and that we have not trespassed (beyond the truth): if we did, behold! the wrong be upon us!\"",
  "en_ctr_asad": "But if afterwards it should come to light that the two [witnesses] have become guilty of [this very] sin, then two others - from among those whom the two former have deprived of their right{{128}} - shall take their place and shall swear by God, \"Our testimony is indeed truer than the testimony of these two, and we have not transgressed the bounds of what is right - or else, may we indeed be counted among the evildoers!\"",
