In the absence of any previous contact, hostile or otherwise, there would have been no point whatever in Solomon's telling the people of Sheba that they should not \"exalt themselves\" against or above himself. On the other hand, the narrative of the hoopoe makes it clear that the Sabaeans did \"exalt themselves\" against God by worshipping the sun and by being convinced \"that they ought not to worship God\" (verses 2-25 above). Hence, Solomon, being a prophet, is justified in calling upon them, in the name of God, to abandon this blasphemy and to surrender themselves to Him. (Cf. the almost identical phrase, \"Exalt not yourselves against God\", in 44:19.)"
