  "ar_text_clean": "يا أيها الذين آمنوا إذا ضربتم في سبيل الله فتبينوا ولا تقولوا لمن ألقى إليكم السلام لست مؤمنا تبتغون عرض الحياة الدنيا فعند الله مغانم كثيرة كذلك كنتم من قبل فمن الله عليكم فتبينوا إن الله كان بما تعملون خبيرا",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "O ye who believe! When ye go abroad in the cause of Allah, investigate carefully, and say not to any one who offers you a salutation: \"Thou art none of a believer!\" Coveting the perishable goods of this life: with Allah are profits and spoils abundant. Even thus were ye yourselves before, till Allah conferred on you His favours: Therefore carefully investigate. For Allah is well aware of all that ye do.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "O ye who believe! When ye go forth (to fight) in the way of Allah, be careful to discriminate, and say not unto one who offereth you peace: \"Thou art not a believer,\" seeking the chance profits of this life (so that ye may despoil him). With Allah are plenteous spoils. Even thus (as he now is) were ye before; but Allah hath since then been gracious unto you. Therefore take care to discriminate. Allah is ever Informed of what ye do.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "O you who believe! when you go to war in Allah's way, make investigation, and do not say to any one who offers you peace: You are not a believer. Do you seek goods of this world's life! But with Allah there are abundant gains; you too were such before, then Allah conferred a benefit on you; therefore make investigation; surely Allah is aware of what you do.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "O you who believe! When you go (to fight) in the Cause of Allah, verify (the truth), and say not to anyone who greets you (by embracing Islam): \"You are not a believer\"; seeking the perishable goods of the worldly life. There are much more profits and booties with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you yourselves before till Allah conferred on you His Favours (i.e. guided you to Islam), therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "O Ye who believe! when ye march forth in the way of Allah, make things clear and say not unto one who giveth you a salutation: thou art none of a believer, seeking the perishable goods of the life of the world; for with Allah are spoils abundant. Even Thus were ye aforetime, then Allah favoured you. So make things clear; verily Allah is of that which ye work ever Aware.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Believers, if you are journeying in the way of Allah, do not say to those who offer you peace, until it has been clarified: 'You are not believers, ' seeking the enjoyment of the worldly life, with Allah there are many spoils. You were like that before, and Allah has been gracious to you. Therefore let it be clarified. Surely, Allah is Aware of what you do.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "O Believers, when you go forth in the way of God, make clear and do not say to any who offers you greeting of peace, `thou art not a Believer;' you seek the chance goods of the present life, but with God are abundant spoils. Such you were before, then God was gracious to you, hence make clear; God is surely aware of the things you do.",
  "en_tr_sher": "O ye who believe! when you go forth to fight in the cause of God, make proper investigation and say not to anyone who greets you with the greeting of peace, Thou art not a believer.' You seek the goods of this life, but with God are good things in plenty. Such were you before this, but God conferred His special favour on you; so do make proper investigation. Surely, God is Aware of what you do.",
  "en_tr_asad": "[Hence,] O you who have attained to faith, when you go forth [to war] in God's cause, use your discernment, and do not &ndash; out of a desire for the fleeting gains of this worldly life &ndash; say unto anyone who offers you the greeting of peace, \"Thou art not a believer\": for with God there are gains abundant. You, too, were once in the same condition &ndash; but God has been gracious unto you. Use, therefore, your discernment: verily, God is always aware of what you do.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "O believers, when you are journeying in the path of God, be discriminating, and do not say to him who offers you a greeting, Thou art not a believer, seeking the chance goods of the present life.

  "en_tr_maududi": "Believers! When you go forth in the way of Allah, discern (between friend and foe), and do not say to him who offers you the greeting of peace: 'You are not a believer.'{{126}} If you seek the good of this worldly life, there lies with Allah abundant gain. After all, you too were such before, and then Allah was gracious to you.{{127}} Discern, then, for Allah is well aware of what you do.",

  "en_ctr_asad": "[Hence,] O you who have attained to faith, when you go forth [to war] in God's cause, use your discernment, and do not - out of a desire for the fleeting gains of this worldly life - say unto anyone who offers you the greeting of peace, \"Thou art not a believer\":{{119}} for with God there are gains abundant.

The immediate occasion was in connection with jihad, but the words are general, and can be applied to all circumstances in which a man fells through spiritual pride: he thinks he is not as other men are, but forgets that, but for the grace of Allah, he is himself a sinner! In war (or in peace) we are apt to catch some worldly advantage by pluming ourselves on our superiority in Faith. In war perhaps we want to gain glory or booty by killing a supposed enemy! In peace we make light of other people in order to steal some advantage or material gain! This is wrong. The righteous man, if he is really out in Allah's service, has more abundant and richer gifts to think of in the spiritual world."
