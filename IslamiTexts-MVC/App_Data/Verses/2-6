Where there is such desire, the Grace and Mercy of Allah gives guidance. But that guidance is not efficacious when it is deliberately rejected, and the possibility of rejection follows from the grant of free will. The consequence of the rejection is that the spiritual faculties become dead or impervious to better influences, See also n. 93, n. 3557, and n. 3644."

This interpretation is supported by many commentators, especially Zamakhshari (who, in his commentary on this verse, uses the expression, \"those who have deliberately resolved upon their kufr\"). Elsewhere in the Qur'an such people are spoken of as having \"hearts with which they fail to grasp the truth, and eyes with which they fail to see, and ears with which they fail to hear\" (7:179). - For an explanation of the terms kufr (\"denial of the truth\"), kafir (\"one who denies the truth\"), etc., see note 4 on 74:10, where this concept appears for the first time in Qur'anic revelation."
