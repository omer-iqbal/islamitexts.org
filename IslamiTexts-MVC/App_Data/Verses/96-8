This noun has here a twofold implication: \"everyone will inescapably be brought before God for judgment\", as well as \"everything that exists goes back to God as its source\". In ultimate analysis, the statement expressed in verses 6-8 rejects as absurd the arrogant idea that man could ever be self-sufficient and, hence, \"master of his own fate\"; furthermore, it implies that all moral concepts - that is, all discrimination between good and evil, or right and wrong - are indissolubly linked with the concept of man's responsibility to a Supreme Power: in other words, without such a feeling of responsibility - whether conscious or subconscious - the concept of \"morality\" as such loses all its meaning."
