      "note": "Lit., \"lean mount\" - an expression which has induced some of the commentators to assume that it denotes \"a camel that has become lean on account of a long and fatiguing journey\". However, the verb dammarahu or admarahu relates in classical Arabic not only to camels but also to horses, and has the meaning of \"he made it [i.e., the mount] lean and fit [for racing or war]\"; thus, the noun midmar signifies \"a training-ground where horses are prepared for racing or war\", as well as \"a race-course\" (Jawhari, Asas, etc.; cf. also Lane V, 1803 f.). Hence, the adjectival noun damir - especially when contrasted, as above, with the expression rijalan (\"on foot\") - has the connotation of \"fleetness\" or, more properly, \"fitness for speed\", and may by inference be applied to every kind of \"fast conveyance\"."
