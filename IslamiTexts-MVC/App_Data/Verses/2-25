For the manner in which I have translated it, I am indebted to Muhammad 'Abduh (in Manar I, 232 f.), who interprets the phrase, \"It is this that in days of yore was granted to us as our sustenance\" as meaning: \"It is this that we have been promised during our life on earth as a requital for faith and righteous deeds.\" In other words, man's actions and attitudes in this world will be mirrored in their \"fruits\", or consequences, in the life to come - as has been expressed elsewhere in the Qur'an in the verses, \"And he who shall have done an atom's weight of good, shall behold it; and he who shall have done an atom's weight of evil, shall behold it\" (99:7-8). As regards the reference to \"spouses\" in the next sentence, it is to be noted that the term zawj (of which azwaj is the plural) signifies either of the two components of a couple - that is, the male as well as the female."
