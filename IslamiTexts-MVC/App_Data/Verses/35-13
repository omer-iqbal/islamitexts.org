  "en_tr_yusuf": "He merges Night into Day, and he merges Day into Night, and he has subjected the sun and the moon (to his Law): each one runs its course for a term appointed. Such is Allah your Lord: to Him belongs all Dominion. And those whom ye invoke besides Him have not the least power.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "He maketh the night to pass into the day and He maketh the day to pass into the night. He hath subdued the sun and moon to service. Each runneth unto an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the Sovereignty; and those unto whom ye pray instead of Him own not so much as the white spot on a date-stone.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "He causes the night to enter in upon the day, and He causes the day to enter in upon the night, and He has made subservient (to you) the sun and the moon; each one follows its course to an appointed time; this is Allah, your Lord, His is the kingdom; and those whom you call upon besides Him do not control a straw.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "He merges the night into the day (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the night are added to the hours of the day), and He merges the day into the night (i.e. the decrease in the hours of the day are added to the hours of the night). And He has subjected the sun and the moon, each runs its course for a term appointed. Such is Allah your Lord; His is the kingdom. And those, whom you invoke or call upon instead of Him, own not even a Qitmir (the thin membrane over the date-stone).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "He plungeth the night into the day and He plungeth the day into the night, and He hath subjected the sun and moon, each running till an appointed term. Such is Allah, your Lord; His is the dominion; and those whom ye call on besides Him own not even the husk of a date-stone.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "He causes the night to enter into the day and the day into the night. He has subjected the sun and the moon each running for a named term. Such is Allah, your Lord. To Him belongs the Kingdom; and those whom you call upon, other than Him, do not possess even as much as the membrane of a datestone.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "He makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night, and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running to a stated term. That is God, your Lord, to whom belongs the kingdom; and those whom you call upon, apart from Him, do not possess even the skin of a date-stone.",
  "en_tr_sher": "He merges the night into the day, and He merges the day into the night. And He has pressed into service the sun and the moon, each runs its course to an appointed term. Such is God, your Lord; His is the Kingdom, and those whom you call upon beside God own not even a whit.",
  "en_tr_asad": "He makes the night grow longer by shortening the day, and He makes the day grow longer by shortening the night; and He has made the sun and the moon subservient [to His laws], each running its course for a term set [by Him]. \nThus is God, your Sustainer: unto Him belongs all dominion &ndash; whereas those whom you invoke instead of Him do not own so much as the husk of a date-stone!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "He makes the night to enter into the day and makes the day to enter into the night, and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each of them running to a stated term.

  "en_tr_maududi": "He causes the night to phase into the day and the day into the night,{{30}} and He has subjected the sun and the moon, each running its course to an appointed term.{{31}} That is Allah, your Lord; to Him belongs the Kingdom; but those whom you call upon, apart from Allah, possess not so much as the skin of a date-stone.{{32}}",
