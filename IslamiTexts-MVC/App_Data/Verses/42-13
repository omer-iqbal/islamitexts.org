  "ar_text_clean": "شرع لكم من الدين ما وصى به نوحا والذي أوحينا إليك وما وصينا به إبراهيم وموسى وعيسى أن أقيموا الدين ولا تتفرقوا فيه كبر على المشركين ما تدعوهم إليه الله يجتبي إليه من يشاء ويهدي إليه من ينيب",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah - the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein: to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them. Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).",
  "en_tr_pickth": "He hath ordained for you that religion which He commended unto Noah, and that which We inspire in thee (Muhammad), and that which We commended unto Abraham and Moses and Jesus, saying: Establish the religion, and be not divided therein. Dreadful for the idolaters is that unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth for Himself whom He will, and guideth unto Himself him who turneth (toward Him).",
  "en_tr_shakir": "He has made plain to you of the religion what He enjoined upon Nuh and that which We have revealed to you and that which We enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa that keep to obedience and be not divided therein; hard to the unbelievers is that which you call them to; Allah chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns (to Him), frequently.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "He (Allah) has ordained for you the same religion (Islam) which He ordained for Nuh (Noah), and that which We have inspired in you (O Muhammad SAW), and that which We ordained for Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses) and 'Iesa (Jesus) saying you should establish religion (i.e. to do what it orders you to do practically), and make no divisions in it (religion) (i.e. various sects in religion). Intolerable for the Mushrikun, is that to which you (O Muhammad SAW) call them. Allah chooses for Himself whom He wills, and guides unto Himself who turns to Him in repentance and in obedience.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "He hath instituted for you in religion that which He had enjoined upon Nuh,  and which We have revealed Unto thee, and which We had enjoined upon Ibrahim and Musa and Isa, saying: establish the religion, and be not divided therein. Grievous Unto the associaters is that Unto which thou callest them. Allah chooseth for Himself whomsoever He will  and guideth Unto Himself whomsoever turneth in penitence.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "He has made plain for you the Religion with which He charged Noah and that which We have revealed to you, and that with which We charged (Prophets)Abraham, Moses and Jesus, (saying): 'Establish the Religion and do not be divided therein. ' That which you invite them to is too overwhelming for the idolaters. Allah brings close to Himself whom He will, and guides to Him those who turn in repentance.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "He has laid down for you of the religion, as He charged Noah with, and that We have revealed to thee, and that We charged Abraham, Moses and Jesus with: `Establish the Religion and be not divided in it'. Hard upon the idolaters is to which thou callest them; God chooses to Himself whom He will, and He guides to Himself who turns to him.",
  "en_tr_sher": "He has prescribed for you the religion which He enjoined on Noah, and which We have now revealed to thee, and which We enjoined on Abraham and Moses and Jesus, viz., 'Establish obedience to God in the earth, and be not divided therein. Hard upon the idolaters is that to which thou callest them. God chooses for Himself whom He pleases, and guides to Himself him who turns to Him.'",
  "en_tr_asad": "In matters of faith, He has ordained for you that which He had enjoined upon Noah &ndash; and into which We gave thee [O Muhammad] insight through revelation &ndash; as well as that which We had enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: Steadfastly uphold the [true] faith, and do not break up your unity therein. \n[And even though] that [unity of faith] to which thou callest them appears oppressive to those who are wont to ascribe to other beings or forces a share in His divinity, God draws unto Himself everyone who is willing, and guides unto Himself everyone who turns unto Him.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "He has laid down for you as religion that He charged Noah with, and that We have revealed to thee, and that We charged Abraham with, Moses and Jesus: Perform the religion, and scatter not regarding it. Very hateful is that for the idolaters, that thou callest them to. God chooses unto Himself whomsoever He will, and He guides to Himself whosoever turns, penitent.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "He has prescribed for you the religion which He enjoined upon Noah and which We revealed to you (O Muhammad), and which We enjoined upon Abraham and Moses and Jesus, commanding: \"Establish this religion and do not split up regarding it.\"{{20}} What you are calling to is very hard upon those who associate others with Allah in His Divinity. Allah chooses for Himself whomsoever He pleases and guides to Himself whoever penitently turns to Him.{{21}}",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "The same religion has He established for you as that which He enjoined on Noah -{{4541}} the which We have sent by inspiration to thee - and that which We enjoined on Abraham, Moses, and Jesus: Namely, that ye should remain steadfast in religion, and make no divisions therein:{{4542}} to those who worship other things than Allah, hard is the (way) to which thou callest them.{{4543}} Allah chooses to Himself those whom He pleases, and guides to Himself those who turn (to Him).",
  "en_ctr_asad": "In matters of faith,{{12}} He has ordained for you that which He had enjoined upon Noah - and into which We gave thee [O Muhammad] insight through revelation{{13}} - as well as that which We had enjoined upon Abraham, and Moses, and Jesus: Steadfastly uphold the [true] faith, and do not break up your unity therein.{{14}} [And even though] that [unity of faith] to which thou callest them appears oppressive to those who are wont to ascnbe to other beings or forces a share in His divinity, God draws unto Himself everyone who is willing, and guides unto Himself everyone who turns unto Him.",
