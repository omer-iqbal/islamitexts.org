They deny Revelation; they deny a future life, as the Sadducees did among the Jews before them; they persecute the Prophet of Allah, and those who believe in him: and they mockingly demand that their ancestors should be brought back to life, if it is true that there is a future life. They are reminded that better men than they lived in their own country of Arabia, men who had knowledge of Allah's revelation under the earliest Dispensation. See next note. They perished because of their unbelief and wrongdoing. What chance have they unless they turn and repent?"
