The signification of (1) I have explained in the note to 3:62, as far as they relate to Jesus. In a more general sense, it means the clear evidence which Allah's dealings furnish about a man of God having a true mission; e.g., Moses in relation to Pharaoh, (2) The word Zubur has been translated as scriptures. It comes from the root Zobam which implies something hard. The commentators are not agreed, but the prophetic writings which seemed to contemporaries difficult to understand may well be meant here. David's psalms (Zabur, 4:163 and 21:105) may also come under this description. As to (3), there is no doubt about the literal meaning of the words, \"the Book of Enlightenment\". But what does it precisely refer to? I take it to mean the fundamental guide to conduct-the clear rules laid down in all Dispensations to help men to lead good lives. (R)."
