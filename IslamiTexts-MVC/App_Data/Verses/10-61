  "en_tr_qarib": "You are not engaged in any matter, neither do you recite any portion of the Koran, nor do you do any work, except that We are witnesses over you when you press upon it?

Human knowledge is subject to time, and is obliterated by time. Allah's knowledge is like a Record and endures forever. And His Record has a further quality which human records have not. The most permanent human record may be quite intelligible to those who make it but may be ambiguous to others and may become unintelligible with the progress of time, as happens almost invariably to the most enduring inscriptions from very ancient times: but in Allah's \"Record\" or knowledge there is no ambiguity, for it is independent of time, or place, or circumstance.
