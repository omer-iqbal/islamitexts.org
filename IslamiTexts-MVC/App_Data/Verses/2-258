  "ar_text_clean": "ألم تر إلى الذي حاج إبراهيم في ربه أن آتاه الله الملك إذ قال إبراهيم ربي الذي يحيي ويميت قال أنا أحيي وأميت قال إبراهيم فإن الله يأتي بالشمس من المشرق فأت بها من المغرب فبهت الذي كفر والله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham About his Lord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: \"My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death.\" He said: \"I give life and death\". Said Abraham: \"But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West.\" Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith. Nor doth Allah Give guidance to a people unjust.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Bethink thee of him who had an argument with Abraham about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom; how, when Abraham said: My Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death, he answered: I give life and cause death. Abraham said: Lo! Allah causeth the sun to rise in the East, so do thou cause it to come up from the West. Thus was the disbeliever abashed. And Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Have you not considered him (Namrud) who disputed with Ibrahim about his Lord, because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim said: My Lord is He who gives life and causes to die, he said: I give life and cause death. Ibrahim said: So surely Allah causes the sun to rise from the east, then make it rise from the west; thus he who disbelieved was confounded; and Allah does not guide aright the unjust people.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Have you not looked at him who disputed with Ibrahim (Abraham) about his Lord (Allah), because Allah had given him the kingdom? When Ibrahim (Abraham) said (to him): \"My Lord (Allah) is He Who gives life and causes death.\" He said, \"I give life and cause death.\" Ibrahim (Abraham) said, \"Verily! Allah causes the sun to rise from the east; then cause it you to rise from the west.\" So the disbeliever was utterly defeated. And Allah guides not the people, who are Zalimun (wrong-doers, etc.).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Bethinkest thou not of one who contended with Ibrahim concerning his Lord, because Allah had vouchsafed  unto him dominion! When Ibrahim said: my Lord is He Who giveth life and causeth death, he said: give life and cause death. Ibrahim said: verily Allah bringeth the sun from the east, then bring it thou from the west. Thereupon he Who disbelieved Was dumb-founded, And Allah guideth not a wrong-doing people.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Have you not seen he who argued with Abraham about his Lord that Allah had given him the kingship! When Abraham said: 'My Lord is He who revives, and causes to die. ' He said: 'I revive, and cause to die. ' Abraham said: 'Allah brings up the sun from the east; so you bring it from the west! ' Then he who disbelieved became pale. Allah does not guide the nation, the harmdoers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Hast thou not considered him who disputed with Abraham concerning his Lord, because God had given him the kingship? When Abraham said, `my Lord is He who gives life and makes to die', he said `I also give life and make to die.' Abraham said, `God brings the sun from the East, bring it thou from the West', and the unbeliever was dumb-founded; but God does not guide the wrong-doing people.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Hast thou not heard of him who disputed with Abraham about his Lord, because God has given him kingdom? When Abraham said, 'My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death,' he said, 'I also give life and cause death.' Abraham said, 'Well, God brings the sun from the East; bring it thou from the West,' Thereupon the infidel was confounded. And God guides not the unjust people.",
  "en_tr_asad": "ART THOU NOT aware of that [king] who argued with Abraham about his Sustainer, [simply] because God had granted him kingship? \nLo! Abraham said: \"My Sustainer is He who grants life and deals death.\"\n[The king] replied: \"I [too] grant life and deal death!\"\nSaid Abraham: \"Verily, God causes the sun to rise in the east; cause it, then, to rise in the west!\"\nThereupon he who was bent on denying the truth remained dumbfounded: for God does not guide people who [deliberately] do wrong.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Hast thou not regarded him who disputed with Abraham, concerning his Lord, that God had given him the kingship? When Abraham said, My Lord is He who gives life, and makes to die, he said, I give life, and make to die. Said Abraham, God brings the sun from the east; so bring thou it from the west. Then the unbeliever was confounded. God guides not the people of the evildoers.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Have{{289}} you not considered the case of the person who had an argument with Abraham{{290}} as to `Whom Abraham acknowledged as his Lord?' The dispute arose because Allah had given him the kingship,{{291}} (which had made him arrogant). When Abraham said, \"My Lord is He Who gives life and causes death,\" he answered, \"I give life and cause death.\" Then Abraham said, \"Well, Allah brings the sun from the east: just bring it from the west.\" At this the disbeliever was confounded:{{292}} (yet he did not believe), for Allah does not show guidance to unjust people.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Hast thou not Turned thy vision to one who disputed with Abraham{{302}} About his Lord, because Allah had granted him power? Abraham said: \"My Lord is He Who Giveth life and death.\" He said: \"I give life and death\". Said Abraham: \"But it is Allah that causeth the sun to rise from the east: Do thou then cause him to rise from the West.\" Thus was he confounded who (in arrogance) rejected faith.

      "note": "The three verses 258-260 have been the subject of much controversy as to the exact meaning to be attached to the incidents and the precise persons alluded to, whose names are not mentioned. In such matters, where the Qur'an has given no names and the Prophet has himself given no indication, it seems to me useless to speculate, and still worse to put forward positive opinions. In questions of learning, speculations are often interesting. But it seems to me that the meaning of the Qur'an is so wide and universal that we are in danger of missing the real and eternal meaning if we go on disputing about minor points. All three incidents are such as may happen again and again in any prophet's lifetime, and be seen in impersonal vision at any time. Here they are connected with Al Mustafa's vision as shown by the opening words of verse 258. (R)."

      "note": "The first point illustrated is the pride of power, and the impotence of human power as against Allah's power. The person who disputed with Abraham may have been Nimrod or some ruler in Babylonia, or indeed elsewhere. I name Babylonia as it was the original home of Abraham (Ur of the Chaldees), and Babylon prided herself on her arts and sciences in the ancient world. Science can do many wonderful things; it could then; it can now. But the mystery of Life baffled science then, as it continues to baffle science now, after many centuries of progress. Abraham had faith, and referred back everything to the true Cause of Causes. A sceptical ruler might jestingly say: \"I have the power of life and death.\" A man of science might say: \"We have investigated the laws of life and death.\" Different kinds of powers lie in the hands of kings and men of knowledge. The claim in both cases is true in a very limited sense. But Abraham confounded the claimer by going back to fundamentals. \"If you had the ultimate power, why could you not make the sun rise from the West?\""
