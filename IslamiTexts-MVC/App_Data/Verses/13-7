Since the last of the above three interpretations is the most plausible and has, moreover, the support of Abd Allah ibn Abbas, Sa'id ibn Jubayr, Mujahid and Ad-Dahhak, I have adopted it in my rendering. According to Zamakhshari, this interpretation is further strengthened by the subsequent reference to God's omniscience."
