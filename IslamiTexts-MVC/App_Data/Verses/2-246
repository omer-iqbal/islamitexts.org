  "en_tr_yusuf": "Hast thou not Turned thy vision to the Chiefs of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Moses? they said to a prophet (That was) among them: \"Appoint for us a king, that we May fight in the cause of Allah.\" He said: \"Is it not possible, if ye were commanded to fight, that that ye will not fight?\" They said: \"How could we refuse to fight in the cause of Allah, seeing that we were turned out of our homes and our families?\" but when they were commanded to fight, they turned back, except a small band among them. But Allah Has full knowledge of those who do wrong.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Bethink thee of the leaders of the Children of Israel after Moses, how they said unto a prophet whom they had: Set up for us a king and we will fight in Allah's way. He said: Would ye then refrain from fighting if fighting were prescribed for you? They said: Why should we not fight in Allah's way when we have been driven from our dwellings with our children? Yet, when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned away, all save a few of them. Allah is aware of evil-doers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Have you not considered the chiefs of the children of Israel after Musa, when they said to a prophet of theirs: Raise up for us a king, (that) we may fight in the way of Allah. He said: May it not be that you would not fight if fighting is ordained for you? They said: And what reason have we that we should not fight in the way of Allah, and we have indeed been compelled to abandon our homes and our children. But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned back, except a few of them, and Allah knows the unjust.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Have you not thought about the group of the Children of Israel after (the time of) Musa (Moses)? When they said to a Prophet of theirs, \"Appoint for us a king and we will fight in Allah's Way.\" He said, \"Would you then refrain from fighting, if fighting was prescribed for you?\" They said, \"Why should we not fight in Allah's Way while we have been driven out of our homes and our children (families have been taken as captives)?\" But when fighting was ordered for them, they turned away, all except a few of them. And Allah is All-Aware of the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Bethinkest thou not of the chiefs of the Children of Isra'il, after Musa? They said unto a Prophet of theirs: raise for us a king that we may fight in the way of God. He said: may it not be that if fighting were prescribed unto you, ye would not fight! They said: and wherefore shall we not fight in the way of God, whereas we have been driven forth from our habitations and children. Then when fighting was prescribed unto them, they turned away, save a few of them: and Allah is the Knower of the wrong-doers.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Have you not seen the congregation of the Children of Israel who demanded of one of their Prophets after (the death of) Moses? 'Raise up for us a king, ' they said, 'and we will fight in the way of Allah. ' He replied: 'Might it be that if fighting is written for you, you will not fight? ' 'Why shouldn't we fight in the way of Allah, ' they replied, 'when we and all our children have been driven from our dwellings? ' Yet, when fighting was written for them all except for a few, turned away. And Allah has knowledge of the harmdoers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Hast thou not considered the chiefs of the Children of Israel, after Moses? When they said to a Prophet of theirs, `raise up for us a king, and we will fight in the way of God;' he said, `may it be that, if fighting is prescribed for you, you will not fight?' They said, `why should we not fight in the way of God, when we have been expelled from our homes and our children?' Yet when fighting was prescribed for them, they turned their backs except a few of them; and God knows the wrong-doers.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Hast thou not heard of the chiefs of the Children of Israel after Moses, when they said to a Prophet of theirs, 'Appoint for us a king that we may fight in the way of God?' He said, 'It is not likely that you will not fight, if fighting is prescribe for you?'

But when fighting was ordained for them, they turned back except a small number of them. And God knows the transgressors well.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Art thou not aware of those elders of the children of Israel, after the time of Moses, how they said unto a prophet of theirs, \"Raise up a king for us, [and] we shall fight in God's cause\"? \nSaid he: \"Would you, perchance, refrain from fighting if fighting is ordained for you?\"\nThey answered: \"And why should we not fight in God's cause when we and our children have been driven from our homelands?\"\nYet, when fighting was ordained for them, they did turn back, save for a few of them; but God had full knowledge of the evildoers.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Hast thou not regarded the Council of the Children of Israel, after Moses, when they said to a Prophet of theirs, Raise up for us a king, and we will fight in Gods way. He said, Might it be that, if fighting is prescribed for you, you will not fight? They said, Why should we not fight in Gods way, who have been expelled from our habitations and our children?

  "en_tr_maududi": "Have you also reflected upon the matter concerning the chiefs of the Israelites after (the death of) Moses? They said to their Prophet, \"Appoint a king for us so that we may fight in the way of Allah.\"{{268}} The Prophet asked them, \"Might it be that you will not fight, if fighting is prescribed for you?\" They replied, \"How can it be that we would refuse to fight in the way of Allah when we have been turned out of our homes and separated from our children?\" But (in spite of this assurance) when they were enjoined to fight, they all, except a few of them, turned their backs. And Allah knows each and everyone of these transgressors.",

His rule lasted for 25 years, after which there was a period of 320 years when the Israelites had a chequered history. They were not united among themselves, and suffered many reverses at the hands of the Midianites, Amalekites, and other tribes of Palestine. They frequently lapsed into idolatry and deserted the worship of the true God. From time to time a leader appeared among them who assumed dictatorial powers. Acting under a sort of theocratic commission from Allah, he pointed out their backslidings, reunited them under His banner, and restored, from time to time and place to place, the power of Israel. These dictators are called Judges in the English translation of the Old Testament. The last of their line was Samuel, who marks the transition towards the line of Kings on the one hand and of the later Prophets on the other. He may be dated approximately about the 11th century B.C."

The Philistines had made a great attack and defeated Israel with great slaughter. The Israelites, instead of relying on Faith and their own valour and cohesion, brought out their most sacred possession, the Ark of the Covenant, to help them in the fight. But the enemy captured it, carried it away, and retained it for seven months. The Israelites forgot that wickedness cannot screen itself behind a sacred relic. Nor can a sacred relic help the enemies of faith. The enemy found that the Ark brought nothing but misfortune for themselves, and were glad to abandon it. It apparently remained twenty years in the village (qaryah) of Ya'arim (Kirjath jearim): I. Samuel, 7:2. Meanwhile the people pressed Samuel to appoint them a king.
