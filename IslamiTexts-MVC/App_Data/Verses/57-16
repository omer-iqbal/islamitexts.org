  "en_tr_yusuf": "Has not the Time arrived for the Believers that their hearts in all humility should engage in the remembrance of Allah and of the Truth which has been revealed (to them), and that they should not become like those to whom was given Revelation aforetime, but long ages passed over them and their hearts grew hard? For many among them are rebellious transgressors.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Is not the time ripe for the hearts of those who believe to submit to Allah's reminder and to the truth which is revealed, that they become not as those who received the scripture of old but the term was prolonged for them and so their hearts were hardened, and many of them are evil-livers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Has not the time yet come for those who believe that their hearts should be humble for the remembrance of Allah and what has come down of the truth? And that they should not be like those who were given the Book before, but the time became prolonged to them, so their hearts hardened, and most of them are transgressors.",

And many of them were Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Is not the time yet come unto those who believe, that their hearts should humble themselves to the admonition of Allah and to the truth which hath come down, and that they become not as those who were vouchsafed the Book aforetime, and the time become extended unto them, and so their hearts became hard? And many of them are transgressors",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Is it not time that the hearts of the believers be humbled to the Remembrance of Allah and the truth which He has sent down? They should not be like those who were given the Book before this, whose time became very long so that their hearts became hardened. Many of them were impious.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Has not the time for the Believers come that their hearts should be humbled to the Remembrance of God and to the Truth that He has sent down, and that they should not be like those who were given the Book before, then the term became long over them, so their hearts became hard; and many of them are transgressors?",
  "en_tr_sher": "Has not the time yet arrived for those who believe that their hearts should feel humbled at the remembrance of God and at the truth which has come down to them, and that they should not become like those who were given the Book before them, but because the period of the bestowal of God's grace upon them was prolonged for them, their hearts became hardened, and many of them became rebellious?",
  "en_tr_asad": "IS IT NOT time that the hearts of all who have attained to faith should feel humble at the remembrance of God and of all the truth that has been bestowed [on them] from on high, lest they become like those who were granted revelation aforetime, and whose hearts have hardened with the passing of time so that many of them are [now] depraved?",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Is it not time that the hearts of those who believe should be humbled to the Remembrance of God and the Truth which He has sent down, and that they should not be as those to whom the Book was given aforetime, and the term seemed over long to them, so that their hearts have become hard, and many of them are ungodly?",
