Let us just consider the phrases used at the beginning of the six Alif, Lam, Mim Surahs of which this is the last in order of arrangement. In 10:1 we read, \"Ay at (or verses or Signs) of the Book of Wisdom\", the theme being the wonders of Allah's creation, and its relation to His Revelation. In 11:1 we read, \"a Book, with verses basic or fundamental, further explained in detail\": the theme is Allah's Justice and Punishment, to preserve the fundamental scheme of His Laws. In 12:1 we read, \"The Symbols (or verses) of the Perspicuous Book\": the wonderful unfolding of Allah's Plan is explained in Joseph's story. In 13:1 we read, \"The Signs (or verses) of the Book\": the contrasts in the modes of Allah's Revelation and its reception by man are pointed out, but not illustrated by detailed examples as in Joseph's perspicuous story. In 14:1 we read \"A Book . . . revealed ... to lead ... out of... darkness into light\": the theme being Abraham's prayer for man to be rescued from the darkness of false worship into the light of Unity. Here in 15:1 we read, \"Ayat (or verses) of Revelation-of a Qur'an that makes things clear (or perspicuous)\": the theme being an explanation of evil, and how Allah's Truth is protected from it."
