It implies: (1) fine, subtle (the basic meaning); (2) so fine and subtle as to be imperceptible to human sight; (3) so pure as to be incomprehensible; (4) with sight so perfect as to see and understand the finest subtleties and mysteries (Cf. 33:34); (5) so kind and gracious as to bestow gifts of the most refined kind; extraordinarily gracious and understanding. No. 4 is the predominant meaning here and in 12:100; Nos. 2 and 3 in 6:103; and No. 5 in 42:19; but every shade of meaning must be borne in mind in each case, as a subsidiary factor in the spiritual melody."
