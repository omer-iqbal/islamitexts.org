Many interpretations of this term (derived from hawar, \"whiteness\") are given by the commentators, ranging from \"one who whitens clothes by washing them\" (because this was allegedly the occupation of some of Jesus' disciples) to \"one who wears white garments\", or \"one whose heart is white\", i.e., pure (cf. Tabari, Razi, Ibn Kathir). It is, however, most probable - and the evidence provided by the recently discovered Dead Sea Scrolls strongly supports this view - that the term hawari was popularly used to denote a member of the Essene Brotherhood, a Jewish religious group which existed in Palestine at the time of Jesus, and to which, possibly, he himself belonged. The Essenes were distinguished by their strong insistence on moral purity and unselfish conduct, and always wore white garments as the outward mark of their convictions; and this would satisfactorily explain the name given to them. The fact that the Prophet once said, \"Every prophet has his hawari \" (Bukhari and Muslim) does not conflict with the above view, since he obviously used this term figuratively, recalling thereby Jesus' \"helpers in God's cause\"."
