But it was not an ordinary fire. It was a Burning Bush; a Sign of the Glory of Allah."

Moses, when he grew up, left the palace of Pharaoh and went to the Midianite people, in the Sinai peninsula. He married among them, and was now travelling with his family and his flocks, when he was called to his mission by Allah. He went to look for a fire for comfort and guidance. He found a higher and holier comfort and guidance. The whole passage is full of portent meaning, which is reflected in the short rhymed verses in the original. (R)."

This part of the story relates to the period of his wanderings subsequent to his flight from Egypt (see 28:14 ff.).
