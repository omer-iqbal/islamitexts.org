  "ar_text_clean": "ضربت عليهم الذلة أين ما ثقفوا إلا بحبل من الله وحبل من الناس وباءوا بغضب من الله وضربت عليهم المسكنة ذلك بأنهم كانوا يكفرون بآيات الله ويقتلون الأنبياء بغير حق ذلك بما عصوا وكانوا يعتدون",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Shame is pitched over them (Like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and slew the prophets in defiance of right; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Ignominy shall be their portion wheresoever they are found save (where they grasp) a rope from Allah and a rope from men. They have incurred anger from their Lord, and wretchedness is laid upon them. That is because they used to disbelieve the revelations of Allah, and slew the prophets wrongfully. That is because they were rebellious and used to transgress.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Abasement is made to cleave to them wherever they are found, except under a covenant with Allah and a covenant with men, and they have become deserving of wrath from Allah, and humiliation is made to cleave to them; this is because they disbelieved in the communications of Allah and slew the prophets unjustly; this is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Indignity is put over them wherever they may be, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah, and from men; they have drawn on themselves the Wrath of Allah, and destruction is put over them. This is because they disbelieved in the Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Allah and killed the Prophets without right. This is because they disobeyed (Allah) and used to transgress beyond bounds (in Allah's disobedience, crimes and sins).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Stuck upon them is abjection wheresoever they may be come upon, except in a compact with Allah and a compact with men; and they drew upon themselves indignation from Allah; and stuck upon them is poverty. That is because they have been disbelieving in the signs of Allah, and slaying the prophets without justice. That is because they disobeyed and have been trespassing.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Abasement shall be pitched upon them wherever they are found, except they are in a bond from Allah, and a bond of the people. They have incurred theAnger of Allah and have been humiliated, because they disbelieved the verses of Allah and unjustly slew His Prophets and because they disobeyed and were transgressors.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Abasement is pitched on them wherever they are come upon, except by the bond of God and the bond of men, and they are laden with God's wrath, and misery is pitched on them; that is because they disbelieved in the signs of God and killed the Prophets without right; that is because they disobeyed and exceeded the limits.",
  "en_tr_sher": "They shall be smitten with abasement wherever they are found unless they are protected by a covenant with God or by a covenant with men. They have incurred the wrath of God, and they have been smitten with wretchedness. That is because they rejected the Signs of God and sought to slay the Prophets unjustly. That is because they rebelled and used to transgress.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Overshadowed by ignominy are they wherever they may be, save [when they bind themselves again] in a bond with God and a bond with men; for they have earned the burden of God's condemnation, and are overshadowed by humiliation: all this [has befallen them] because they persisted in denying the truth of God's messages and in slaying the prophets against all right: all this, because they rebelled [against God], and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Abasement shall be pitched on them, wherever they are come upon, except they be in a bond of God, and a bond of the people; they will be laden with the burden of Gods anger, and poverty shall be pitched on them; that, because they disbelieved in Gods signs, and slew the Prophets without right; that, for that they acted rebelliously and were transgressors.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Wherever they were, they were covered with ignominy, except when they were protected by either a covenant with Allah or a covenant with men.{{90}} They are laden with the burden of Allah's wrath, and humiliation is stuck upon them - and all this because they rejected the signs of Allah and slayed the Prophets without right, and because they disobeyed and transgressed.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Shame is pitched over them{{435}} (Like a tent) wherever they are found, except when under a covenant (of protection) from Allah and from men; they draw on themselves wrath from Allah, and pitched over them is (the tent of) destitution. This because they rejected the Signs of Allah, and slew the prophets in defiance of right{{436}}; this because they rebelled and transgressed beyond bounds.",
  "en_ctr_asad": "Overshadowed by ignominy are they wherever they may be, save [when they bind themselves again] in a bond with God and a bond with men;{{83}} for they have earned the burden of God's condemnation, and are overshadowed by humiliation: all this [has befallen them] because they persisted in denying the truth of God's messages and in slaying the prophets against all right: all this, because they rebelled [against God], and persisted in transgressing the bounds of what is right.{{84}}",

The tent of the wicked wherever they are found is ignominy, shame, and humiliation. It is pity from Allah or from men that gives them protection when their pride has a fall. Using the same simile of a tent in another way, their home will be destitution and misery."
