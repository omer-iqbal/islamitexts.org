Verily, God is all-hearing, all-knowing!",

However, none of these accounts attains to the standard of authenticity described as sahih (i.e., \"reliable\") by the great exponents of the science of Tradition (ilm al-hadith), and cannot, therefore, satisfactorily explain the above Qur'anic passage (see Ibn Kathir's commentary on this verse, as well as Manar IX, 620 f.). Since the verb rams (lit., \"he cast\" or \"flung\") applies also to the act of \"shooting an arrow\" or \"flinging a spear\", it might be explained here as a reference to the Prophet's active participation in the battle. Alternatively, it may denote his \"casting terror\", i.e., into the hearts of his enemies, by his and his followers' extreme valour. Whichever explanation is adopted, the above verse implies that the victory of the Muslims over the much more numerous and much better equipped army of the Quraysh was due to God's grace alone: and, thus, it is a reminder to the faithful, of all times, not to indulge in undue pride in any of their achievements (which is the meaning of the \"test\" mentioned in the next sentence)."
