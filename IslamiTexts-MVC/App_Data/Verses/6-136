  "en_tr_yusuf": "Out of what Allah hath produced in abundance in tilth and in cattle, they assigned Him a share: they say, according to their fancies: \"This is for Allah, and this\" - for our \"partners\"! but the share of their\" partners \"reacheth not Allah, whilst the share of Allah reacheth their \"partners\" ! evil (and unjust) is their assignment!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "They assign unto Allah, of the crops and cattle which He created, a portion, and they say: \"This is Allah's\" - in their make-believe - \"and this is for (His) partners in regard to us.\" Thus that which (they assign) unto His partners in them reacheth not Allah and that which (they assign) unto Allah goeth to their (so-called) partners. Evil is their ordinance.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And they set apart a portion for Allah out of what He has created of tilth and cattle, and say: This is for Allah-- so they assert-- and this for our associates; then what is for their associates, it reaches not to Allah, and whatever is (set apart) for Allah, it reaches to their associates; evil is that which they judge.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And they assign to Allah a share of the tilth and cattle which He has created, and they say: \"This is for Allah according to their pretending, and this is for our (Allah's so-called) partners.\" But the share of their (Allah's so-called) \"partners\" reaches not Allah, while the share of Allah reaches their (Allah's so-called) \"partners\"! Evil is the way they judge!",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And they'll appoint for Allah, of the tilth and cattle He hath produced, a portion, they say according to their fancy: this is for Allah, and: this for our associate-gods. Then, that which is for their associate-gods reacheth not Allah, while that which is for Allah reacheth their associate-gods; vile is the way they judge!",
  "en_tr_qarib": "They set aside for Allah a share of what He has created of tilth and cattle saying: 'This is for Allah so they claim and this for our associates (gods). ' The share of their associates never reaches Allah, but the share of Allah reaches their associates. How evil they judge!",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And they assign to God, a part of what He has produced of the tillage and cattle, saying, `this is for God', __ they assert __ `and this is for our associate-gods.' Then what is for their associate-gods, does not reach God, but what is for God reaches their associate-gods; how evil do they judge!",
  "en_tr_sher": "And they have assigned God a portion of the crops and cattle which He has produced, and they say, 'This is for God,' -- so they assert -- 'and this is for our associate-gods.' But that which is for their associate-gods reaches not God while that which is for God reaches their associate-gods. Evil is what they judge.",

Bad, indeed, is their judgment!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "They appoint to God, of the tillage and cattle that He multiplied, a portion, saying, This is for God -- so they assert -- and this is for our associates. So what is for their associates reaches not God; and what is for God reaches their associates. Evil is their judgment!",

The shares assigned to the \"partners\" went to the priests and hangers-on of the \"partners\", who were many and clamorous for their rights. The share assigned to Allah possibly went to the poor, but more probably went to the priests who had the cult of the \"partners\", for the Supreme God had no separate priests of His own. It is also said that when heaps were thus laid out, if any portion of Allah's heap fell into the heaps of the \"partners\" the priests greedily and promptly appropriated it, while in the contrary case the \"partners\" priests were careful to reclaim any portion from what they called \"Allah's heap.\" The absurdity of the whole thing is ridiculed.
