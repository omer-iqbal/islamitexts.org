Most of the commentators assume that the hypocrites were thus alluding to the Prophet's alleged propensity to believe everything - good or bad - that he was told about other people (cf. Manar X, 600). Since, however, there is no historical evidence of such a \"propensity\" on his part, it seems to me that what the hypocrites referred to was the Prophet's readiness to listen to what they - in common with many other unbelievers regarded as mere hallucinatory sounds, and to interpret them \"mistakenly\" as revelations. This would explain the statement that \"they malign the Prophet\" - namely, by attributing to him self-deception - and that this saying of theirs \"amounts to a denial of the truth\" (see verse 74 of this surah). - The verb adha signifies primarily \"he molested\" or \"annoyed [another]\", i.e., in a manner not amounting to actual harm (darar). Since in the above context this verb is used in the sense of making a derogatory remark, yu'dhun is best rendered as \"they malign\"."
