In the great pomp and circumstances of the world, it may be neglected or even trampled on by a people who mean it no harm. Yet, by its wisdom, it carries on its own life within its own sphere (\"habitations\") unmolested, and makes a useful contribution to the economy of the world. So there is room for the humblest people in the spiritual world."
