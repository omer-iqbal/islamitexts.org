The true, pure, and sincere love of Khadijah not only raised him above want, but made him independent of worldly needs in his later life, enabling him to devote his whole time to the service of Allah.

When we have found the Way, it is a laborious task to climb up in our poverty of spiritual equipment: Allah will give us spiritual riches in love and knowledge."
