Although Zamakhshari does not quite agree with this interpretation, it is, in my opinion, very convincing inasmuch as it contains an allusion to the highly allegorical character of the concept of \"paradise\" as a spiritual consequence of one's positive endeavours in this world, That its delights are not of a material nature is also evident from their varying descriptions - i.e., \"a cup flavoured with ginger\" in verse 17, and \"flavoured with the calyx of sweet-smelling flowers\" in verse 5; or \"they will be waited upon with trays and goblets of gold\" in 43:71, and \"vessels of silver and goblets that will [seem to] be crystal crystal-like, [but] of silver\", in verses 15-16 of this surah; and so forth."
