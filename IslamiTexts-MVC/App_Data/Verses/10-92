Some Egyptologists assume that the \"evil Pharaoh\" of the Qur'an and the Bible was Ramses II (about 1324-1258 B.C.), while others identify him with his unlucky predecessor, Tut-ankh-amen, or even with Thotmes (or Thutmosis) III, who lived in the 15th century B.C. However, all these \"identifications\" are purely speculative and have no definitive historical value. In this connection it should be remembered that the designation \"Pharaoh\" (fir'awn in Arabic) is not a proper name but a title borne by all the kings of ancient Egypt."
