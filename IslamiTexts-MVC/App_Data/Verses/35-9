(1) Dry, unpromising soil may seem, to all intents and purposes, dead; there is no source of water near; moisture is sucked up by the sun's heat in a far-off ocean, and clouds are formed; winds arise; it seems as if the wind \"bloweth as it listeth\", but it is really Allah's Providence that drives it to the dead land; the rain falls, and behold! mere is life and motion and beauty everywhere! So in the spiritual world. Allah's Revelation is His Mercy and His Rain; there may be the individual resurrection (Nushur) or unfolding of a. soul. (2) So again, may be the general Resurrection (Nushur), the unfolding of a new World in the Hereafter, out of an old World that is folded up and dead (Takwir, S. 81)."
