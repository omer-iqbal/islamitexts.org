But whosoever cannot afford (that), then he should fast for three days. That is the expiation for the oaths when you have sworn. And protect your oaths (i.e. do not swear much). Thus Allah make clear to you His Ayat (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) that you may be grateful.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Allah shall not take you to task for the vain in your oaths; but he shall take you to task for that which your oaths make binding.
