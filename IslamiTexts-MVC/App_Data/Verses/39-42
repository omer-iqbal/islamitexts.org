As far as animal life is concerned, it is the cessation of the working of the nervous system, though other animal functions, such as digestion, growth, and the circulation of the blood, continue, possibly at a different pace. It is the repose of the nervous system, and in this respect it is common to man and animals, and perhaps even to plants, if, as is probable, plants have a nervous system. The mental processes (and certainly volition) are also suspended in sleep, except that in ordinary dreams there is a medley of recollections, which often present vividly to our consciousness things that do not or cannot happen in nature as we know it in our coordinated minds. But there is another kind of dream which is rarer-one in which the dreamer sees things as they actually happen, backwards or forwards in time, or in which gifted individuals see spiritual truths otherwise imperceptible to them. How can we explain this? It is suggested that our soul or personality-that something which is above our animal life-is then in a plane of spiritual existence akin to physical death (see last note), when we are nearer to Allah. In poetic imagery, Sleep is \"twin-brother to Death\"."

Beyond this, however, we have here a reminder - in tune with the subsequent passages - of God's almightiness, and especially of His exclusive power to create and to withdraw life. As to the operative verb yatawaffa; it primarily denotes \"He takes [something] away in full\"; and because death is characterized by a disappearance of all vital impulses (the \"soul\") from the once-living body - their being \"taken away in full\", as it were - this form of the verb has been used tropically, since time immemorial, in the sense of \"causing to die\", and (in its intransitive form) \"dying\" or (as a noun) \"death\": a usage invariably adhered to in the Qur'an. The traditional likening of sleep to death is due to the fact that in both cases the body appears to be devoid of consciousness, partially and temporarily in the former case, and completely and permanently in the latter. (The popular translation of anfus - pi. of nafs - as \"souls\" is certainly inappropriate in the above context, since, according to the fundamental teaching of the Qur'an, man's soul does not \"die\" at the time of his bodily death but, on the contrary, lives on indefinitely. Hence, the term anfus must be rendered here as \"human beings\".)"
