  "ar_text_clean": "وقال رجل مؤمن من آل فرعون يكتم إيمانه أتقتلون رجلا أن يقول ربي الله وقد جاءكم بالبينات من ربكم وإن يك كاذبا فعليه كذبه وإن يك صادقا يصبكم بعض الذي يعدكم إن الله لا يهدي من هو مسرف كذاب",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "A believer, a man from among the people of Pharaoh, who had concealed his faith, said: \"Will ye slay a man because he says, 'My Lord is Allah'?- when he has indeed come to you with Clear (Signs) from your Lord? and if he be a liar, on him is (the sin of) his lie: but, if he is telling the Truth, then will fall on you something of the (calamity) of which he warns you: Truly Allah guides not one who transgresses and lies!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who hid his faith, said: Would ye kill a man because he saith: My Lord is Allah, and hath brought you clear proofs from your Lord? If he is lying, then his lie is upon him; and if he is truthful, then some of that wherewith he threateneth you will strike you. Lo! Allah guideth not one who is a prodigal, a liar.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And a believing man of Firon's people who hid his faith said: What! will you slay a man because he says: My Lord is Allah, and indeed he has brought to you clear arguments from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be his lie, and if he be truthful, there will befall you some of that which he threatens you (with); surely Allah does not guide him who is extravagant, a liar:",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And a believing man of Fir'aun's (Pharaoh) family, who hid his faith said: \"Would you kill a man because he says: My Lord is Allah, and he has come to you with clear signs (proofs) from your Lord? And if he is a liar, upon him will be (the sin of) his lie; but if he is telling the truth, then some of that (calamity) wherewith he threatens you will befall on you.\" Verily, Allah guides not one who is a Musrif (a polytheist, or a murderer who shed blood without a right, or those who commit great sins, oppressor, transgressor), a liar!",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And a believing man of Fir'awn 's household, hiding his belief, said: would ye slay a man because he saith: my Lord is God, and hath come upto you with evidences from your Lord?  If he is a liar, then upon him will be his lie, and if he is a truth-teller, then there will befall you some of that wherewith he threateneth you; verily God guideth not one who is an extravagant and a liar.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "But one of Pharaoh's people, who was in secret a believer, asked: 'Would you kill a man because he says: \"My Lord is Allah?\" He has brought you clear signs from your Lord. If he is lying, let his lie be on his head, but, if he is speaking the truth then at least a part of what he promises will befall you. Allah does not guide the lying sinner.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And a man, a Believer from Pharaoh's folk, who was hiding his belief, said, `will you kill a man because he says, `my Lord is God', and he has brought you the Clear Signs from your Lord? And if he is a liar, his lie shall go against him; and if he is truthful, then some of what he threatens you with, shall befall you; God does not guide him who is extravagant and a liar.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And a believing man from among the people of Pharaoh, who kept hidden his faith, said, 'Will you slay a man because he says, 'My Lord is God,' while he has also brought you clear proofs from your Lord? And if he be a liar, on him will be the sin of his lie; but if he is truthful, then some of that which he threatens you with will, surely, befall you. Certainly, God guides not one who exceeds the bounds and is a great liar;'",
  "en_tr_asad": "At that, a believing man of Pharaoh's family, who [until then] had concealed his faith, exclaimed: \"Would you slay a man because he says, `God is my Sustainer' &ndash; seeing, withal, that he has brought you all evidence of this truth from your Sustainer? Now if he be a liar, his lie will fall back on him; but if he is a man of truth, something [of the punishment] whereof he warns you is bound to befall you: for, verily, God would not grace with His guidance one who has wasted his own self by lying [about Him].",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Then said a certain man, a believer of Pharaohs folk that kept hidden his belief, What, will you slay a man because he says, \"My Lord is God,\" yet he has brought you the clear signs from your Lord? If he is a liar, his lying is upon his own head; but if he is truthful, somewhat of that he promises you will smite you. Surely God guides not him who is prodigal and a liar.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Then a man endowed with faith, from Pharaoh's folk, who had kept his faith hidden, said: \"Do you kill a person simply because he says: 'My Lord is Allah' even though he brought to you clear Signs from your Lord?{{45}} If he is a liar, his lying will recoil upon him;{{46}} but if he is truthful, you will be smitten with some of the awesome consequences of which he warns you. Allah does not guide to the Right Way any who exceeds the limits and is an utter liar.{{47}}",
