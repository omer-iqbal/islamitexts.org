      "note": "The 'Ad people, with their prophet Hud, are mentioned in many places. See especially 26:123-140, and 46:21-26. Their story belongs to Arabian tradition. Their eponymous ancestor 'Ad was fourth in generation from Noah, having been a son of 'Aus, the son of Aram, the son of Sam, the son of Noah. They occupied a large tract of country in Southern Arabia, extending from 'Uman at the mouth of the Persian Gulf to Hadramawt and Yemen at the southern end of the Red Sea. The people were tall in stature and were great builders. Probably the long, winding tracts of sands (ahqaf) in their dominions (46:21) were irrigated with canals. They forsook the true God, and oppressed their people. A three-year famine visited them, but yet they took no warning. At length a terrible blast of wind destroyed them and their land, but a remnant, known as the second 'Ad or the Thamud (see below) were saved, and afterwards suffered a similar fate for their sins. The tomb of the Prophet Hud (qohr Nabi Hud) is still traditionally shown in Hadramut, latitude 15?N and longitude 49V? ?E, about 90 miles north of Mukalla. There are ruins and inscriptions in the neighbourhood. See \"Hadramut: Some of its Mysteries Unveiled,\" by D. van der Meulen and H. von Wissmann, Leyden, 1932. (R)."

      "note": "Hud is said to have been the first Arabian prophet. He may be identical with the Biblical 'Eber, the ancestor of the Hebrews (Tbrim) who - like most of the Semitic tribes - had probably originated in South Arabia. (References to Eber are found in Genesis x, 24-25 and xi, 14 ff.) The ancient Arabian name Hud is still reflected in that of Jacob's son Judah (Yahudah in Hebrew), which provided the subsequent designation of the Jews. The name 'Eber - both in Hebrew and in its Arabic form 'Abir - signifies \"one who crosses over\" (i.e., from one territory to another), and may be a Biblical echo of the fact that this tribe \"crossed over\" from Arabia to Mesopotamia in pre-Abrahamic times. - The tribe of 'Ad, to which Hud belonged (\"their brother Hud\"), inhabited the vast desert region known as Al-Ahqaf, between 'Uman and Hadramawt, and was noted for its great power and influence (see 89:8 - \"the like of whom has never been reared in all the land\"). It disappeared from history many centuries before the advent of Islam, but its memory always remained alive in Arabian tradition."
