      "note": "The idea that God might have a \"son\" - either in the real or in the metaphorical sense of this term - would presuppose a degree of innate likeness between \"the father\" and \"the son\": but God is in every respect unique, so that \"there is nothing like unto Him\" (42:11) and \"nothing that could be compared with Him\" (112:4). Moreover, the concept of \"progeny\" implies an organic continuation of the progenitor, or of part of him, in another being and, therefore, presupposes a degree of incompleteness before the act of procreation (or incarnation, if the term \"sonship\" is used metaphorically): and the idea of incompleteness, in whatever sense, negates the very concept of God. But even if the idea of \"sonship\" is meant to express no more than one of the different \"aspects\" of the One Deity (as is claimed in the Christian dogma of the \"Trinity\"), it is described in the Qur'an as blasphemous inasmuch as it amounts to an attempt at defining Him who is \"sublimely exalted above anything that men may devise by way of definition\" (see last sentence of 6:100)."
