  "en_tr_yusuf": "O ye who believe! Take not my enemies and yours as friends (or protectors),- offering them (your) love, even though they have rejected the Truth that has come to you, and have (on the contrary) driven out the Prophet and yourselves (from your homes), (simply) because ye believe in Allah your Lord! If ye have come out to strive in My Way and to seek My Good Pleasure, (take them not as friends), holding secret converse of love (and friendship) with them: for I know full well all that ye conceal and all that ye reveal. And any of you that does this has strayed from the Straight Path.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "O ye who believe! Choose not My enemy and your enemy for allies. Do ye give them friendship when they disbelieve in that truth which hath come unto you, driving out the messenger and you because ye believe in Allah, your Lord? If ye have come forth to strive in My way and seeking My good pleasure, (show them not friendship). Do ye show friendship unto them in secret, when I am Best Aware of what ye hide and what ye proclaim? And whosoever doeth it among you, he verily hath strayed from the right way.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "O you who believe! do not take My enemy and your enemy for friends: would you offer them love while they deny what has come to you of the truth, driving out the Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord? If you go forth struggling hard in My path and seeking My pleasure, would you manifest love to them? And I know what you conceal and what you manifest; and whoever of you does this, he indeed has gone astray from the straight path.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "O you who believe! Take not My enemies and your enemies (i.e. disbelievers and polytheists, etc.) as friends, showing affection towards them, while they have disbelieved in what has come to you of the truth (i.e. Islamic Monotheism, this Qur'an, and Muhammad SAW), and have driven out the Messenger (Muhammad SAW) and yourselves (from your homeland) because you believe in Allah your Lord! If you have come forth to strive in My Cause and to seek My Good Pleasure, (then take not these disbelievers and polytheists, etc., as your friends). You show friendship to them in secret, while I am All-Aware of what you conceal and what you reveal. And whosoever of you (Muslims) does that, then indeed he has gone (far) astray, (away) from the Straight Path.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "O ye who believe! take not Mine enemy and your enemy for friends, showing affection toward them, whilst they of a surety disbelieve in that which hath come Unto you of the truth, and have driven forth the apostle and yourselves because ye believe in Allah, your Lord, if ye have come forth to strive in My way and to seek My goodwill. Ye secretly show them affection, while I am best Knower of that which ye conceal and that which ya make known! And whosoever of you doth this, he hath surely strayed from the straight path.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Believers, do not take My enemy and your enemy for your guides, offering them love when they have disbelieved the truth that has come to you, who expelthe Messenger and yourselves because you believe in Allah, your Lord!

  "en_tr_ayubk": "O Believers, do not take My enemies and your enemies for friends, by offering them love, while they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you, expelling the Messenger and you, because you believe in God, your Lord. If you go forth to struggle in My way and seek My pleasure, secretly sending them love, and I know what you conceal and what you announce; and whosoever of you does it has indeed gone astray from the even way.",
  "en_tr_sher": "O ye who believe! take not My enemy and your enemy for friends. Would you offer them love, while they have disbelieved in the Truth which has come to you and have driven out the Messenger and yourselves from your homes, merely because you believe in God, your Lord? When you go forth to strive in My cause and to seek My pleasure, some of you send them messages of love in secret, while I know best what you conceal and what you reveal. And whoever of you does it has, indeed, strayed away from the right path.",
  "en_tr_asad": "O YOU who have attained to faith! Do not take My enemies &ndash; who are your enemies as well &ndash; for your friends, showing them affection even though they are bent on denying whatever truth has come unto you, [and even though] they have driven the Apostle and yourselves away, [only] because you believe in God, your Sustainer! \nIf [it be true that] you have gone forth [from your homes] to strive in My cause, and out of a longing for My goodly acceptance, [do not take them for your friends,] inclining towards them in secret affection: for I am fully aware of all that you may conceal as well as of all that you do openly. And any of you who does this has already strayed from the right path.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "O believers, take not My enemy and your enemy for friends, offering them love, though they have disbelieved in the truth that has come to you, expelling the Messenger and you because you believe in God your Lord.

  "en_tr_maududi": "Believers,{{1}} if you have left (your homes and) have come forth to struggle in My Way and to seek My good pleasure, do not make friends with My enemies and your enemies. You befriend them whereas they have spurned the Truth that has come to you; and (such is their enmity that) they expel the Messenger and yourselves for no other reason than that you believe in Allah, your Lord. You send to them messages of friendship in secrecy, although I know well whatever you do, be it secretly or publicly. And whosoever of you does so has indeed strayed far away from the Straight Path.",

The letter was intercepted, and he confessed the truth. He was forgiven as he told the truth and his motive did not appear to be heinous, but this instruction was given for future guidance. This was shortly before the conquest of Makkah, but the principle is of universal application. You cannot be on terms of secret intimacy with the enemies of your Faith and people, who are persecuting your Faith and seeking to destroy your Faith and you. You may not do so even for the sake of your relatives as it compromises the life and existence of your whole community."
