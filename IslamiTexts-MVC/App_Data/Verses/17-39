It is to be noted that the noun hikmah, usually signifying \"wisdom\", is derived from the verb hakama (\"he prevented\" or \"restrained [him or it]\", i.e., from acting in an undesirable manner). Hence, the primary meaning of hikmah is \"that which prevents one from evil or ignorant behaviour\" (cf. Lane 11, 617); in its positive sense, it signifies \"[conscious] insight into that which is most excellent\" (Lisan al-'Arab, Taj al-'Arus). Inasmuch as this term refers here, in particular, to what is \"odious in God's sight\", it implies moral discrimination (or \"the knowledge of right and wrong\") on the part of men; and this, in its turn, presupposes the existence of an absolute, God-willed standard of moral values."
