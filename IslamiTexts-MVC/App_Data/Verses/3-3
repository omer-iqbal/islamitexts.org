As the word Furqan from this point of view is parallel to the word Intiq a m, which ends the next verse, I have accepted the verse-division at Furqan as more in consonance with Qur'anic rhythm. It makes no real difference to the numbering of the verses, as there is only a question of whether one line should go into verse 3 or verse 4. (R)."

This interpretation is not, however, entirely convincing. Although there is not the least doubt that in this context the pronominal ma refers to earlier revelations, and particularly the Bible (as is evident from the parallel use of the above expression in other Qur'anic passages), the idiomatic phrase ma bayna yadayhi does not, in itself, mean \"that which came before it\" - i.e., in time - but, rather (as pointed out by me in surah 2, note 247), \"that which lies open before it\". Since, however, the pronoun \"it\" relates here to the Qur'an, the metaphorical expression \"between its hands\" or \"before it\" cannot possibly refer to \"knowledge\" (as it does in 2:255), but must obviously refer to an objective reality with which the Qur'an is \"confronted\": that is, something that was coexistent in time with the revelation of the Qur'an. Now this, taken together (a) with the fact - frequently stressed in the Qur'an and since established by objective scholarship - that in the course of the millennia the Bible has been subjected to considerable and often arbitrary alteration, and (b) with the fact that many of the laws enunciated in the Qur'an differ from the laws of the Bible, brings us forcibly to the conclusion that the \"confirmation\" of the latter by the Qur'an can refer only to the basic truths still discernible in the Bible, and not to its time-bound legislation or to its present text - in other words, a confirmation of whatever was extant of its basic teachings at the time of the revelation of the Qur'an: and it is this that the phrase ma bayna yadayhi expresses in this context as well as in 5:46 and 48 or in 61:6 (where it refers to Jesus' confirming the truth of \"whatever there still remained [i.e., in his lifetime] of the Torah\")."
