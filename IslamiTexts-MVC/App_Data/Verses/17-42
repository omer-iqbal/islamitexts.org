But if, as polytheists say, there had been subsidiary gods, they would yet have had to go to the Throne of the Supreme God, for they could have done nothing without Him. Thus the Islamic idea of the unity of the Godhead is quite different from the polytheistic ideas of a supreme god, as in the Greek Pantheon, where Jupiter was often defied by the minor deities! But such ideas are absurd, as stated in the next verse (Cf. 21:21-22 and 23- 91)."

      "note": "The term 'arsh (lit., \"throne\" or, more properly, \"seat of power\") is used in the Qur'an to denote God's absolute sway over all that exists; hence, the expression dhu 'l-'arsh may be suitably rendered as \"He who is enthroned in His almightiness\". Beyond this, the commentators are not entirely agreed as to the purport of the above sentence. Some take it to mean that \"had there been other deities apart from God, they would endeavour to deprive Him of some or all of His power, and would thus create chaos in the universe\". Others - and most prominently among them Tabari and Ibn Kathir have a far better, though somewhat more complicated explanation to offer. Starting from the legitimate assumption that those who believe in the existence of other deities or divine powers apart from God regard them as no more than mediators between man and Him, the argument runs thus: If those alleged divine or semi-divine \"mediators\" would really exist, then it is obvious that, being no more than mediators, even they would have to recognize Him as the Supreme Being - which would amount to admitting that they have no power of their own but are, in the last resort, entirely dependent on and subject to Him: and this unavoidable conclusion implies a negation of any divinity in those imaginary \"mediators\". This being so, is it not far more reasonable for man to turn directly to God, who is almighty, all-seeing, all-hearing, and has therefore no need of any mediator?"
