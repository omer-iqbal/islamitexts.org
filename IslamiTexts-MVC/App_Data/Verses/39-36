If the evil ones wish to frighten him with false gods, he knows that that is mere superstition. In the case of idols to whom worship is paid, this is easily intelligible. But there are other false gods which men worship?wealth, power, science, selfish desire, and so on. The idea may occur to them: \"this is the right course, but what will men say?\" or \"shall I lose my case if I tell the truth?\" or \"will it ruin my chances if I denounce sin in high places?\" All such false gods will only mislead and leave their victims in the lurch. The worship of them will lose them the Grace of Allah, which wants to guide and comfort all who seek Allah."

The godless always stress the supposed necessity of paying attention to all these imaginary forces and values, and frighten themselves and their fellow-men by the thought that a neglect to do so might have evil consequences in their practical life."
