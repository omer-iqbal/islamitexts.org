Muzzammil is one of the titles of our Prophet. But there is a deeper mystic meaning in this and the address \"Thou wrapped up\" of the next Surah. Human nature requires warm garments and wrappings to protect the body from cold or heat or rain. But in the spiritual world these wrappings are useless; the soul must stand bare and open before Allah, in the silence of the night, but not too austerely, as the following verses show."

Hence, the commentators differ widely in their interpretations of the above apostrophe, some of them preferring the literal connotation, others the metaphorical; but there is no doubt that irrespective of the linguistic sense in which the address \"O thou enwrapped one\" is understood, it implies a call to heightened consciousness and deeper spiritual awareness on the part of the Prophet."
