The time must come when they will crumble into dust. Allah has said so in His Revelation; and His word is true.<br/>And so the spiritual lesson from the third episode is: Take human precautions and do all in your power to protect yourselves from evil.

      "note": "Some of the classical commentators (e.g., Tabari) regard this as a prediction of a definite, historic event: namely, the future break-through of the savage tribes of \"Gog and Magog\", who are conceived of as identical with the Mongols and Tatars (see note 95 above). This \"identification\" is mainly based on a well-authenticated Tradition - recorded by Ibn Hanbal, Bukhari and Muslim - which tells us that the Apostle of God had a prophetic dream to which he referred, on awakening, with an exclamation of distress: \"There is no deity save God! Woe unto the Arabs from a misfortune that is approaching: a little gap has been opened today in the rampart of Gog and Magog!\" Ever since the late Middle Ages, Muslims have been inclined to discern in this dream a prediction of the great Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century, which destroyed the Abbasid Empire and, thus, the political power of the Arabs. However, the mention, in verses 99-101 of this surah, of \"the Day\" - i.e., the Day of Judgment - in connection with \"Gog and Magog\" shows that \"the time appointed by my Sustainer\" relates to the coming of the Last Hour, when all works of man will be destroyed. But since none of the Qur'anic references to the \"approach\" or the \"nearness\" of the Last Hour has anything to do with the human concept of time, it is possible to accept both of the above interpretations as equally valid in the sense that the \"coming of the Last Hour\" comprises an indefinite - and, in human terms, perhaps even immensely long span of time, and that the break-through of the godless forces of \"Gog and Magog\" was to be one of the signs of its approach. And, finally, it is most logical to assume (especially on the basis of 21:96-97) that the terms Yajuj and Majuj are purely allegorical, applying not to any specific tribes or beings but to a series of social catastrophes which would cause a complete destruction of man's civilization before the coming of the Last Hour."
