The term hadid denotes, primarily, something that is \"sharp\" in both the concrete and abstract senses of the word: for the latter sense, cf. the Qur'anic phrase \"sharp (hadid) is thy sight today\" (50:22), or the many idiomatic expressions like rajul hadid, \"a man of sharp intellect\", hadid an-nazar; \"one who looks boldly [at others]\", ra'ihah hadidah, \"a sharp odour\", etc. (Lisan al-'Arab). As a noun with a definite article (al-hadid), it signifies \"all that is sharp\", or \"sharpness\", as well as \"iron\". God's having \"softened all sharpness\" in David is evidently an allusion to his exalted sense of beauty (expressed in the poetry of his Psalms) as well as to his goodness and humility. - An alternative rendering of the above phrase would be: \"We caused iron to become soft for him\", which might be an allusion to his outstanding abilities as poet, warrior and ruler."
