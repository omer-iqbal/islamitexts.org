The Commentators differ in opinion as to who is meant, why the title is applied to him, and the point of his being grouped with Isma'il and Idris for constancy and patience. I think the best suggestion is that afforded by Karsten Niebuhr in his Reisebeschreibung nach Arabien, Copenhagen, 1778, 2:264-266, as quoted in the Encyclopaedia of Islam under \"Dhu al Kifl\". He visited Meshed 'Ah in Iraq, and also the little town called Kefil, midway between Najaf and Hillah (Babylon). Kefil, he says, is the Arabic form of Ezekiel. The shrine of Ezekiel was there, and the Jews came to it on a pilgrimage.<br/>If we accept \"Dhu al Kifl\" to be not an epithet, but an Arabicised form of \"Ezekiel\", it fits the context. Ezekiel was a prophet in Israel who was carried away to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar after his second attack on Jerusalem (about B.C. 599). His Book is included in the English Bible (Old Testament). He was chained and bound, and put into prison, and for a time he was dumb, (Ezekiel, 3:25-26). He bore it all with patience and constancy, and continued to reprove boldly the evils in Israel. In a burning passage he denounces false leaders in words which are eternally true: \"Woe be to the shepherds of Israel that do feed themselves! Should not the shepherds feed the flocks? Ye eat the fat, and ye clothe you with the wool, you kill them that are fed: but ye feed not the flock. The diseased have ye not strengthened, neither have ye healed that which was sick, neither have ye bound up that which was broken . . .\", etc. (Ezekiel, 34:2-4).<br/>Dhu al Kifl is again mentioned in 38:48 along with Isma'il and Elisha."

The expression dhu 'l-kifl is derived from the verb kafala and especially the form takaffala - which signifies \"he became responsible [for something or someone]\" or \"pledged himself [to do something]\". Although the classical commentators consider dhu 'l-kifl to be the epithet or the proper name of a particular prophet - whom they variously, more or less at random, identify with Elijah or Joshua or Zachariah or Ezekiel - I fail to see any reason whatever for such attempts at \"identification\", the more so since we have not a single authentic hadlth which would mention, or even distantly allude to, a prophet by this name. I am, therefore, of the opinion that we have here (as in the identical expression in 38:48) a generic term applying to every one of the prophets, inasmuch as each of them pledged himself unreservedly to God and accepted the responsibility for delivering His message to man."
