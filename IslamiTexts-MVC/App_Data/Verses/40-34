  "en_tr_yusuf": "\"And to you there came Joseph in times gone by, with Clear Signs, but ye ceased not to doubt of the (Mission) for which he had come: At length, when he died, ye said: 'No messenger will Allah send after him.' thus doth Allah leave to stray such as transgress and live in doubt,-",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And verily Joseph brought you of old clear proofs, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning what he brought you till, when he died, ye said: Allah will not send any messenger after him. Thus Allah deceiveth him who is a prodigal, a doubter.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And certainly Yusuf came to you before with clear arguments, but you ever remained in doubt as to what he brought; until when he died, you said: Allah will never raise a messenger after him. Thus does Allah cause him to err who is extravagant, a doubter",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And indeed Yusuf (Joseph) did come to you, in times gone by, with clear signs, but you ceased not to doubt in that which he did bring to you, till when he died you said: \"No Messenger will Allah send after him.\" Thus Allah leaves astray him who is a Musrif (a polytheist, oppressor, a criminal, sinner who commit great sins) and a Murtab (one who doubts Allah's Warning and His Oneness).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And assuredly there came Unto you Yusuf aforetime with evidences, yet ye ceased not to be in doubt concerning that which he brought Unto you, until when he died, ye said: God shall by no means raise an apostle after him. Thus Allah keepeth astray one who is extravagant and a doubter.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Before this, Joseph brought you clear signs, but you continued to be doubtful of that which he brought. When he passed away you said: \"Allah will never send another Messenger after him.\" As such Allah leads astray the sinner, the doubter.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And, of course, Joseph brought you the Clear Signs before, but you did not cease doubting what he brought you; until when he died, you said, `God shall not raise any Messenger after him.' Thus does God sends astray him who is extravagant and a doubter,",
  "en_tr_sher": "And Joseph, indeed, came to you before with clear proofs, but you ceased not to be in doubt concerning that which he came to you till, when he died, you said, 'God will never raise a Messenger after him.' Thus does God adjudge as having gone astray every transgressor, doubter -",
  "en_tr_asad": "\"And [remember:] it was to you that Joseph came aforetime with all evidence of the truth; but you never ceased to throw doubt on all [the messages] that he brought you &ndash; so much so that when he died, you said, `Never will God send any apostle [even] after him!' \n\"In this way God lets go astray such as waste their own selves by throwing suspicion [on His revelations] &ndash;",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Joseph brought you the clear signs before, yet you continued in doubt concerning that he brought you until, when he perished, you said, \"God will never send forth a Messenger after him.\" Even, so God leads astray the prodigal and the doubter.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Verily Joseph came to you with Clear Signs before, yet you continued to doubt his Message. Thereafter when he died, you said: 'Allah shall send no Messenger after him.'\"{{51}} Thus Allah leads astray those who transgress the limits and are given to much doubting;",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "\"And to you there came Joseph in times gone by,{{4405}} with Clear Signs, but ye ceased not to doubt of the (Mission) for which he had come: At length, when he died, ye said: ?No messenger will Allah send{{4406}} after him.? thus doth Allah leave to stray such as transgress and live in doubt,-",

Joseph was not born in Egypt, nor was he an Egyptian. With what wonderful incidents he came into Egypt ! What difficulties did he not surmount among his own brothers first, and in the Egyptian family which afterwards adopted him! How injustice, spite, and forgetfulness on the part of others, yet wove a spell round him and made him a ruler and saviour of Egypt in times of famine! How he preached to prisoners in prison, to Zulaykha in her household, to the Egyptian ladies in their banquet, and to the Court of Pharaoh generally! The Egyptians profited by the material gains which came to them through him, but as a nation remained sceptical of his spiritual truths for many generations after him. (Cf. S. 12)."

They actually saw the benefits conferred by Joseph, but did not realise that Allah's Kingdom works continuously even though men ignore it.
