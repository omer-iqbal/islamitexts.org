We told thee that thy Lord doth encompass mankind round about: We granted the vision which We showed thee, but as a trial for men,- as also the Cursed Tree (mentioned) in the Qur'an: We put terror (and warning) into them, but it only increases their inordinate transgression!",

Your Lord has encompassed mankind (i.e. they are in His Grip).\" And We made not the vision which we showed you (O Muhammad as an actual eye-witness and not as a dream on the night of Al-Isra') but a trial for mankind, and likewise the accursed tree (Zaqqum, mentioned) in the Qur'an. We warn and make them afraid but it only increases them in naught save great disbelief, oppression and disobedience to Allah.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And recall what time We said unto thee: verily thy Lord hath encompassed mankind. And We made the vision We shewed thee but a temptation for men, and likewise the tree accurst in the Qur'an. And We frighten them, but it only increaseth them in exorbitance great.",

  "en_tr_sher": "And call to mind when We said to thee, 'Surely, thy Lord has decreed the ruin of this people.' And We made not the vision which We showed thee but as a trial for men, as also the tree cursed in the Qur'?n. And We continue to warn them, but it only increases them in great transgression.",

We said unto thee, [O Prophet:] \"Behold, thy Sustainer encompasses all mankind [within His knowledge and might]: and so We have ordained that the vision which We have shown thee &ndash; as also the tree [of hell,] cursed in this Qur'&#257;n &ndash; shall be but a trial for men.
