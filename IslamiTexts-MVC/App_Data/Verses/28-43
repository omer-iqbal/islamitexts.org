Humanity began as it were with a clean slate again. It was a full Revelation (or Shari'ah') which may be looked at from three points of view: (1) as Light or Insight for men, so that they should not grope in darkness; (2) as a Guide to show them the Way, so that they should not be misled into wrong Paths; and (3) as a Mercy from Allah, so that by following the Way they may receive Allah's Forgiveness and Grace. In 6:91, we have a reference to Light and Guidance in connection with the Revelation of Moses, and in 6:154 we have a reference to Guidance and Mercy in the same connection. Here all three are combined, with the substitution of Basa'ir fosr Nur. Basa'ir is the plural of Basirah, and also be translated Proofs, as I have done in 6:104 Cf. also 7:203, n. 1175, where the word is translated \"Lights\"."
