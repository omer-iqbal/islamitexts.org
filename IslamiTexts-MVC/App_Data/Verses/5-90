      "note": "According to all the lexicographers, the word khamr (derived from the verb khamara, \"he concealed\" or \"obscured\") denotes every substance the use of which obscures the intellect, i.e., intoxicates. Hence, the prohibition of intoxicants laid down in this verse comprises not merely alcoholic drinks, but also drugs which have a similar effect. The only exception from this total prohibition arises in cases of \"dire necessity\" (in the strictest sense of these words), as stipulated in the last sentence of verse 3 of this surah: that is to say, in cases where illness or a bodily accident makes the administration of intoxicating drugs or of alcohol imperative and unavoidable. - As regards the expression \"idolatrous practices\" (ansab, lit., \"idolatrous altars\"), see note 8 of this surah. This term has, I believe, been used here metaphorically, and is meant to circumscribe all practices of an idolatrous nature - like saint-worship, the attribution of \"magic\" properties to certain inanimate objects, the observance of all manner of superstitious taboos, and so forth. - For an explanation of the expression rendered by me as \"divining of the future\" (al-azlam, lit., \"divining-arrows\"), see note 9 on the second paragraph of verse 3 of this surah."
