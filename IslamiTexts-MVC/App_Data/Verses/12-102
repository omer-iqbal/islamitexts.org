However much they concert their plans and unite their forces, whatever dark plots they back with all their resources?the plan of Allah works irresistibly, and sweeps away all their machinations. The good win through in the end, but not always as they planned; the evil are foiled, and often their very plots help the good. What did the brothers desire in trying to get rid of Joseph, and what actually happened? How the Courtier's wife, encouraged by the corrupt women of her acquaintance, tried and failed to seduce Joseph and how Allah listened to his prayer and saved him from her vile designs? How wrong was it of the cupbearer to forget Joseph, and yet how his very forgetfulness kept Joseph safe and undisturbed in prison until the day came when he should tackle the great problems of King's kingdom? With every character in the story there are problems, and the whole is a beautifully balanced picture of the working of Allah's Providence in man's chequered destiny. (R)."
