Other authorities, however, (e.g., Abu Muslim, as quoted by Razi) prefer the original significance of this term and explain it as more or less synonymous with al-muhajiran (\"those who forsake the domain of evil\"). To my mind, the expression as-sa'ihun is best rendered as \"those who go on and on [seeking God's goodly acceptance]\", thus combining the literal and metonymical connotations of the term siyahah."
