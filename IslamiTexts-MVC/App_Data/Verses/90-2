Actually his life was being sought, and those who believed in him were under a ban.

The classical commentators give to the term balad the connotation of \"city\", and maintain that the phrase hadha 'l-balad (\"this city\") signifies Mecca, and that the pronoun \"thou\" in the second verse refers to Muhammad. Although this interpretation is plausible in view of the fact that the sacredness of Mecca is repeatedly stressed in the Qur'an, the sequence as well as the tenor of the whole surah - seems to warrant a wider, more general interpretation. In my opinion, the words hadha 'l-balad denote \"this land of man\", i.e., the earth (which latter term is, according to all philologists, one of the primary meanings of balad). Consequently, the \"thou\" in verse 2 relates to man in general, and that which is metaphorically \"called to witness\" is his earthly environment."
