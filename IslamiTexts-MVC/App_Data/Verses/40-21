  "en_tr_yusuf": "Do they not travel through the earth and see what was the End of those before them? They were even superior to them in strength, and in the traces (they have left) in the land: but Allah did call them to account for their sins, and none had they to defend them against Allah.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Have they not travelled in the land to see the nature of the consequence for those who disbelieved before them? They were mightier than these in power and (in the) traces (which they left behind them) in the earth. Yet Allah seized them for their sins, and they had no protector from Allah.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Have they not travelled in the earth and seen how was the end of those who were before them? Mightier than these were they in strength-- and in fortifications in the land, but Allah destroyed them for their sins; and there was not for them any defender against Allah.",

  "en_tr_dbadi": "Have they not travelled about in the land so that they may behold of what wise hath been the end of those who were before them?  They were mightier than these in strength and in the traces in the land. Yet Allah laid hold of them for their sins, and from Allah they had none as protector.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Have they never journeyed through the land and seen what was the end of those who have gone before them? They were stronger than themselves in might and left firmer traces in the earth, but Allah seized them for their sinning, and they had none to protect them from Allah.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And have they not journeyed in the land and seen how was the end of those before them? They were stronger than themselves, in might and in leaving traces in the earth, yet God seized them for their sins; and they had none to save them from God.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Have they not traveled in the earth that they could see what was the end of those before them? They were mightier than these in power and they left firmer marks in the earth. But God seized them for their sins, and they had no one to protect them from God.",
