As regards the expression al-asma' al-husna (lit., \"the most perfect [or \"most goodly\"] names\"), which occurs in the Qur'an four times - i.e., in the above verse as well as in 17:110, 20:8 and 59:24 - it is to be borne in mind that the term ism is, primarily, a word applied to denote the substance or the intrinsic attributes of an object under consideration, while the term al-husna is the plural form of al-ahsan (\"that which is best\" or \"most goodly\"). Thus, the combination al-asma' al-husna may be appropriately rendered as \"the attributes of perfection\" - a term reserved in the Qur'an for God alone."
