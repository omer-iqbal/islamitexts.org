But there are occasions when human feelings get the better of our wise resolutions, or when, in a state of conflict or war, we return \"as good as we get \". In that case our retaliation is permissible, provided the injury we inflict is not greater than that we receive. After such retaliation, we are even, but if the other side again acts aggressively and goes beyond all bounds in attacking us, we are entitled to protection from Allah in spite of all our faults; for Allah is One that blots out our sins, and forgives again and again."

Since such an all-out war might seem to conflict with the principle of limited retaliation alluded to above, the Qur'an states that God absolves the believers of what otherwise might have been a sin, since it is they \"against whom war is being wrongfully waged\" (verse 39) by repeated acts of aggression."
