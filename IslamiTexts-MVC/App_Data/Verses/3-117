  "en_tr_yusuf": "What they spend in the life of this (material) world May be likened to a wind which brings a nipping frost: It strikes and destroys the harvest of men who have wronged their own souls: it is not Allah that hath wronged them, but they wrong themselves.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "The likeness of that which they spend in this life of the world is as the likeness of a biting, icy wind which smiteth the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves, and devastateth it. Allah wronged them not, but they do wrong themselves.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "The likeness of what they spend in the life of this world is as the likeness of wind in which is intense cold (that) smites the seed produce of a people who haw done injustice to their souls and destroys it; and Allah is not unjust to them, but they are unjust to themselves.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "The likeness of what they spend in this world is the likeness of a wind which is extremely cold; it struck the harvest of a people who did wrong aginst themselves and destroyed it, (i.e. the good deed of a person is only accepted if he is a monotheist and believes in all the Prophets of Allah, including Christ and Muhammad SAW). Allah wronged them not, but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "The likeness  of that which they expend in this life of the world is as the likeness of a wind wherein is intense cold, it befalleth the tilth of a people who have wronged themselves, and destroyeth it. Allah wronged them not, but themselves they wrong.",

  "en_tr_sher": "The likeness of what they spend for the present life is as the likeness of a wind wherein there is intense cold. It smites the harvest of a people who have wronged themselves and destroys it. And God wronged them not but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_asad": "The parable of what they spend on the life of this world is that of an icy wind which smites the tilth of people who have sinned against themselves, and destroys it: for it is not God who does them wrong, but it is they who are wronging themselves.",

      "note": "False \"spending\" may be either in false \"charity\" or in having a \"good time\". For the man who resists Allah's purpose, neither of them is any good. The essence of charity is faith and love. Where these are wanting, charity is not charity. Some baser motive is there: ostentation, or even worse, getting a person into the giver's power by a pretence of charity: something that is connected with the life of this grasping, material world. What happens? You expect a good harvest. But \"while you think, good easy man, for surely your greatness is a-ripening,\" there comes a nipping frost, and destroys all your hopes. The frost is some calamity, or the fact that you are found out! Or perhaps it is \"High blown pride,\" as in Shakespeare's Henry VIII, 2:3. In your despair you may blame blind Fate or you may blame Allah! Blind Fate does not exist, for there is Allah's Providence, which is just and good. The harm or injustice has come, not from Allah, but from your own soul. You wronged your soul, and it suffered the frost. Your base motive brought you no good: it may have reduced you to poverty, shame, and disgrace. All the brave show of the wicked in this life is but a wind charged with evil to themselves."
