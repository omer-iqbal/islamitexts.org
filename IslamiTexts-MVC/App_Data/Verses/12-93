      "note": "It will be remembered that they had covered their crime by taking his shirt, putting on the stains of blood, and pretending that he had been killed by a wolf: see above, 12:17-18. Now that they have confessed their crime and been forgiven, and they have joyful news to tell Jacob about Joseph. Joseph gives them another shirt of his to prove the truth of their story. It is a rich shirt, befitting a ruler of Egypt, to prove his good fortune, and yet perhaps its design and many colours (12:18. n. 1651) were reminiscent of the lost Joseph. The first shirt plunged Jacob into grief This one will now restore him. See the verses following."

According to him, there is no compelling reason to assume that Jacob had become really blind from grief. - The phrase \"lay it over my father's face\" could also be rendered as \"lay it before my father\", since the term wajh (lit., \"face\") is often used in classical Arabic to denote, metonymically, one's whole personality, or whole being."
