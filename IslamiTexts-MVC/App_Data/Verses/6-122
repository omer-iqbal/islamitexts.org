  "en_tr_yusuf": "Can he who was dead, to whom We gave life, and a light whereby he can walk amongst men, be like him who is in the depths of darkness, from which he can never come out? Thus to those without faith their own deeds seem pleasing.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Is he who was dead and We have raised him unto life, and set for him a light wherein he walketh among men, as him whose similitude is in utter darkness whence he cannot emerge? Thus is their conduct made fairseeming for the disbelievers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Is he who was dead then We raised him to life and made for him a light by which he walks among the people, like him whose likeness is that of one in utter darkness whence he cannot come forth? Thus what they did was made fair seeming to the unbelievers.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Is he who was dead (without Faith by ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him life (by knowledge and Faith) and set for him a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk amongst men, like him who is in the darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and hypocrisy) from which he can never come out?

  "en_tr_dbadi": "Is he who was dead, and We quickened him and appointed for him a light whereby he walketh among mankind, like unto him whose similitude is that he is in darknesses forth from which he cannot come? Even so is made fair-seeming to the infidels that which they are wont to do.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Is he who was dead whom We have revived and given a light with which he walks among people to be compared to him who blunders about in darkness from which he will never emerge? As such what the unbelievers have done appear decorated to them.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And is he who was dead and We gave him life and appointed for him a light by which he walks among men, as one whose likeness is in the darkness, wherefrom he cannot come forth? So are adorned for the unbelievers the things they are doing.",

  "en_tr_arberry": "Why, is he who was dead, and We gave him life, and appointed for him a light to walk by among the people as one whose likeness is in the shadows, and comes not forth from them? So it is decked out fair to the unbelievers the things they have done.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "He who was dead and whom We raised to life,{{88}} and We set a light for him to walk among men - is he like the one steeped in darkness out of which he does not come out?{{89}}. Thus have their own doings been made to seem fair to the unbelievers.{{90}}",

      "note": "Here is an allegory of the good man with his divine mission and the evil man with his mission of evil. The former, before he got his spiritual life, was like one dead. It was Allah's grace that gave him spiritual life, with a Light by which he could walk and guide his own footsteps as well as the footsteps of those who are willing to follow Allah's light. The opposite type is that which hates Allah's light, which lives in the depths of darkness, and which plots and burrows against all that is good. But the plots of evil recoil on itself, although it thinks that mey will hurt the good. Can these two types be for a moment compared with each other? Perhaps the lead in every centre of populations is taken by the men of evil. But file good men should not be discouraged. They should work in righteousness and fulfil their mission."
