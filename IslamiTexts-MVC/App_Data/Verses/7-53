On the day the event is finally fulfilled, those who disregarded it before will say: \"The messengers of our Lord did indeed bring true (tidings). Have we no intercessors now to intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back? then should we behave differently from our behaviour in the past.\" In fact they will have lost their souls, and the things they invented will leave them in the lurch.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Await they aught save the fulfilment thereof? On the day when the fulfilment thereof cometh, those who were before forgetful thereof will say: The messengers of our Lord did bring the Truth! Have we any intercessors, that they may intercede for us? Or can we be returned (to life on earth), that we may act otherwise than we used to act? They have lost their souls, and that which they devised hath failed them.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Do they wait for aught but its final sequel? On the day when its final sequel comes about, those who neglected it before will say: Indeed the messengers of our Lord brought the truth; are there for us then any intercessors so that they should intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back so that we should do (deeds) other than those which we did? Indeed they have lost their souls and that which they forged has gone away from them.",

On the Day the event is finally fulfilled (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), those who neglected it before will say: \"Verily, the Messengers of our Lord did come with the truth, now are there any intercessors for us that they might intercede on our behalf? Or could we be sent back (to the first life of the world) so that we might do (good) deeds other than those (evil) deeds which we used to do?\" Verily, they have lost their ownselves (i.e. destroyed themselves) and that which they used to fabricate (invoking and worshipping others besides Allah) has gone away from them.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "They await only its fulfilment. The Day whereon the fulfilment thereof arriveth, those who were negligent thereof afore shall say: surely the apostles of our Lord brought the truths; are there for us any intercessors that they might intercede for us? or could we be sent back that we may work otherwise than we were wont to work? Surely they have lost themselves, and there hath strayed from them that which they were wont to fabricate.",

' They have lost their souls, and that which they invented will have gone astray from them.",

The day its interpretation comes, those who forgot it before, shall say, `the Messengers of our Lord came with the truth; now are there any intercessors to intercede for us, or shall we be returned to do other than that we have been doing?' They have indeed given loss to themselves and that they were forging is lost to them.",

On the day when the fulfillment thereof shall come, those who had forgotten it before shall say, 'The Messengers of our Lord did indeed bring the Truth. Have we then any intercessors to intercede for us? Or could we be sent back so that we might do good deeds, other than that which we used to do?' They have indeed ruined their souls and that which they used to fabricate has failed them.",

Have we, then, any intercessors who could intercede in our behalf? Or could we be brought back [to life] so that we might act otherwise than we were wont to act?\" \nIndeed, they will have squandered their own selves, and all their false imagery will have forsaken them.",
