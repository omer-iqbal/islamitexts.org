The noun tayr is a plural of ta'ir (\"flying creature\" or \"bird\"), or an infinitive noun (\"flying\") derived from the verb tara (\"he flew\"). In pre-Islamic usage, as well as in the Qur'an, the words ta'ir and tayr often denote \"fortune\" or \"destiny\", whether good or evil (as, for instance, in 7:131, 27:47 or 36:19, and still more clearly in 17:13). Many instances of this idiomatic use of tayr and ta'ir are given in all the authoritative Arabic dictionaries; see also Lane V, 1904 f. Thus, in the parabolic manner so beloved by him, Jesus intimated to the children of Israel that out of the humble clay of their lives he would fashion for them the vision of a soaring destiny, and that this vision, brought to life by his God-given inspiration, would become their real destiny by God's leave and by the strength of their faith (as pointed out at the end of this verse)."
