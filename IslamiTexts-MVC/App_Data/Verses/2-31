The particular qualities or feelings which were outside the nature of angels were put by Allah into the nature of man. Man was thus able to love and understand love, and thus plan and initiate, as becomes the office of vicegerent. The angels acknowledged this. These things they could only know from the outside, but they had faith, or belief in the Unseen. And they knew that Allah saw all - what others see, what others do not see, what others may even wish to conceal. Man has many qualities which are latent or which he may wish to suppress or conceal, to his own detriment. (R)."

The term ism (\"name\") implies, according to all philologists, an expression \"conveying the knowledge [of a thing] ... applied to denote a substance or an accident or an attribute, for the purpose of distinction\" (Lane IV, 1435): in philosophical terminology, a \"concept\". From this it may legitimately be inferred that the \"knowledge of all the names\" denotes here man's faculty of logical definition and, thus, of conceptual thinking.
