The fact that beasts, which in their wild state are so noxious, are, when domesticated, so useful to man, is itself one of the great and standing Signs of Allah's care for man. The great usefulness of cattle is very instructive. They serve for riding, and many of them for food; further, they are used for the plough, and they produce milk, or wool or hair; and from their carcases man derives bones and horns for many industrial uses; but passing on to the higher aspects of life, they further social, moral, and spiritual uses as draught-animals, in that transport serves one of the fundamental purposes of civilisation, being in this respect like ships for international commerce: 30:46, and n. 3565. It is by means of human intercourse through transport that we can carry out the highest needs of our culture, \"any need there may be in our hearts\", i.e., in our inner being."
