As regards the expression la-qulna - here rendered as \"we could certainly [ourselves] compose\" - it is to be remembered that the verb gala does not always signify only \"he said\", but also \"he asserted\" or \"expressed an opinion\", as well as-in connection with a literary production - \"he composed\": thus, qala shi'r means \"he composed a poem\". In the above context, this expression alludes to the oft-repeated (but never fulfilled) boast of the pagan Quraysh that they could produce a poetic message comparable in merit to that of the Qur'an; in its wider sense, it is an allusion to the attitude of many unbelievers towards revealed scriptures in general."
