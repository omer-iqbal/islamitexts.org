  "en_tr_yusuf": "Do not the Unbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were joined together (as one unit of creation), before we clove them asunder? We made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were of one piece, then We parted them, and we made every living thing of water? Will they not then believe?",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Do not those who disbelieve see that the heavens and the earth were closed up, but We have opened them; and We have made of water everything living, will they not then believe?",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Have not those who disbelieve known that the heavens and the earth were joined together as one united piece, then We parted them? And We have made from water every living thing. Will they not then believe?",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Have not these who disbelieve considered that the heavens and the earth were closed up, then We rent them? And We have made of water everything living; will they not then believe?",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Have the unbelievers not seen that the heavens and the earth were sewn up as one (solid) mass, then We unstitched them, and that We made every living thing of water? Will they not believe!",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And have the unbelievers not considered that the heavens and the earth were a mass joined together, then We split them? And We made every living thing of water. Will they not then believe?",
  "en_tr_sher": "Do not the disbelievers see that the heavens and the earth were a closed up-mass, then We opened them out? And We made of water every living thing. Will they not then believe?",
  "en_tr_asad": "ARE, THEN, they who are bent on denying the truth not aware that the heavens and the earth were [once] one single entity, which We then parted asunder? &ndash; and [that] We made out of water every living thing? Will they not, then, begin to believe?",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Have not the unbelievers then beheld that the heavens and the earth were a mass all sewn up, and then We unstitched them and of water fashioned every living thing? Will they not believe?",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Have not the people, who have disbelieved (the Message), ever considered this: the heavens and the earth were at first one mass; then We parted them,{{28}} and created every living thing from water?{{29}} Do they not acknowledge (that this is Our Creation)?",

Physical facts point to the throwing off of planets from vast quantities of diffused nebular matter, of which the central condensed core is a sun."

This shows the predominance of water on our Globe. That all life began in the water is also a conclusion to which our latest knowledge in biological science points. Apart from the fact that protoplasm, the original basis of living matter, is liquid or semi-liquid and in a state of constant flux and instability, there is the fact that land animals, like the higher vertebrates, including man, show, in their embryological history, organs like those of fishes, indicating the watery origin of their original habitat. The constitution of protoplasm is about 80 to 85 percent water (see also 24:30-31 and 24:45)."

      "note": "The statement that God \"made out of water every living thing\" expresses most concisely a truth that is nowadays universally accepted by science. It has a threefold meaning: (1) Water - and, specifically, the sea - was the environment within which the prototype of all living matter originated; (2) among all the innumerable - existing or conceivable - liquids, only water has the peculiar properties necessary for the emergence and development of life; and (3) the protoplasm, which is the physical basis of every living cell - whether in plants or in animals - and represents the only form of matter in which the phenomena of life are manifested, consists overwhelmingly of water and is, thus, utterly dependent on it. Read together with the preceding statement, which alludes to the unitary origin of the physical universe, the emergence of life from and within aa equally unitary element points to the existence of a unitary plan underlying all creation and; hence, to the existence and oneness of the Creator. This accent on the oneness of God and the' unity of His creation is taken up again in verse 92 below."
