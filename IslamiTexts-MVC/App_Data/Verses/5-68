  "ar_text_clean": "قل يا أهل الكتاب لستم على شيء حتى تقيموا التوراة والإنجيل وما أنزل إليكم من ربكم وليزيدن كثيرا منهم ما أنزل إليك من ربك طغيانا وكفرا فلا تأس على القوم الكافرين",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Say: \"O People of the Book! ye have no ground to stand upon unless ye stand fast by the Law, the Gospel, and all the revelation that has come to you from your Lord.\" It is the revelation that cometh to thee from thy Lord, that increaseth in most of them their obstinate rebellion and blasphemy. But sorrow thou not over (these) people without Faith.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Say O People of the Scripture! Ye have naught (of guidance) till ye observe the Torah and the Gospel and that which was revealed unto you from your Lord. That which is revealed unto thee (Muhammad) from thy Lord is certain to increase the contumacy and disbelief of many of them. But grieve not for the disbelieving folk.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Say: O followers of the Book! you follow no good till you keep up the Taurat and the Injeel and that which is revealed to you from your Lord; and surely that which has been revealed to you from your Lord shall make many of them increase in inordinacy and unbelief; grieve not therefore for the unbelieving people.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Say (O Muhammad SAW) \"O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! You have nothing (as regards guidance) till you act according to the Taurat (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), and what has (now) been sent down to you from your Lord (the Qur'an).\" Verily, that which has been sent down to you (Muhammad SAW) from your Lord increases in many of them their obstinate rebellion and disbelief. So be not sorrowful over the people who disbelieve.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Say thou: people of the Book! ye rest not on aught until ye establish the Taurat and the Injil and that which hath now been sent down unto you from your Lord. And that which hath been sent down unto thee will surely increase many of them in exorbitance and infidelity; so mourn thou not over and disbelieving people.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Say: 'People of the Book, you are not upon anything until you establish the Torah and the Gospel and that which is sent down to you from your Lord. ' And that which is sent down to you (Prophet Muhammad) from your Lord will surely increase the tyranny and disbelief of many of them. But do not grieve for the unbelieving nation.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Say, `O People of the Book, you are not on anything until you observe the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to you from your Lord'. And that which has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase many of them in insolence and unbelief; but do not sorrow for the disbelieving people.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Say, 'O People of the Book, you stand on nothing until you observe the Torah and the Gospel and what has now been sent down to you from your Lord.' And surely what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will increase many of them in rebellion and disbelieve; so grieve not for the disbelieving people.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Say: \"O followers of the Bible! You have no valid ground for your beliefs unless you [truly] observe the Torah and the Gospel, and all that has been bestowed from on high upon you by your Sustainer!\" \nYet all that has been bestowed from on high upon thee [O Prophet] by thy Sustainer is bound to make many of them yet more stubborn in their overweening arrogance and in their denial of the truth. But sorrow not over people who deny the truth:",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Say: People of the Book, you do not stand on anything, until you perform the Torah and the Gospel, and what was sent down to you from your Lord. And what has been sent down to thee from thy Lord will surely increase many of them in insolence and unbelief; so grieve not for the people of the unbelievers.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Say to them: 'People of the Book! You have no solid ground to stand on unless you establish the Torah and the Gospel and all that had been revealed to you from your Lord.{{97}} Indeed the message revealed to you from your Lord will aggravate insurgence and unbelief in many of them.{{98}} So do not grieve for those who disbelieve.",

Rebellion may be a passing phase. Want of faith is an attitude of mind that is well-nigh hopeless. Yet the Prophet patiently reasoned with them and bore their taunts and insults. If, the argument runs, you do not believe in anything, even in the things that you may be expected to believe in, how can you receive, in faith, Allah's Message that has come in another form? In fact your jealousy adds to your obstinacy and unbelief."
