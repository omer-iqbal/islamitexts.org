  "en_tr_yusuf": "After them succeeded an (evil) generation: They inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the vanities of this world, saying (for excuse): \"(Everything) will be forgiven us.\" (Even so), if similar vanities came their way, they would (again) seize them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth? and they study what is in the Book. But best for the righteous is the home in the Hereafter. Will ye not understand?",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And a generation hath succeeded them who inherited the scriptures. They grasp the goods of this low life (as the price of evil-doing) and say: It will be forgiven us. And if there came to them (again) the offer of the like, they would accept it (and would sin again). Hath not the covenant of the Scripture been taken on their behalf that they should not speak aught concerning Allah save the truth? And they have studied that which is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better, for those who ward off (evil). Have ye then no sense?",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Then there came after them an evil posterity who inherited the Book, taking only the frail good of this low life and saying: It will be forgiven us. And if the like good came to them, they would take it (too). Was not a promise taken from them in the Book that they would not speak anything about Allah but the truth, and they have read what is in it; and the abode of the hereafter is better for those who guard (against evil). Do you not then understand?",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Then after them succeeded an (evil) generation, which inherited the Book, but they chose (for themselves) the goods of this low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying (as an excuse): \"(Everything) will be forgiven to us.\" And if (again) the offer of the like (evil pleasures of this world) came their way, they would (again) seize them (would commit those sins). Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not say about Allah anything but the truth? And they have studied what is in it (the Book). And the home of the Hereafter is better for those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious - see V.2:2). Do not you then understand?",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Then there succeeded them a posterity; they inherited the Book taking this near world's gear and saying surety it will be forgiven, And if there cometh unto them anot her gear like thereunto they shall take it. Hath there not lain upon them the bond of the Book that they shall not say of God aught but the truth? And they have read that which is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who fear. Understand then ye not?",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Then others succeeded them who inherited the Book and availed themselves of the vanities of this lower world, saying: 'It will be forgiven us. ' But if similar vanities came their way, they would again take them. Have they not taken the covenant of the Book, which they have studied, to tell nothing of Allah except what is true? Surely, the Everlasting Life is better for the cautious, do you not understand!",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Then there succeeded after them a succession who inherited the Book, taking the goods of this world and saying, `it will be forgiven us'; ; but if goods the like of them come to them again they take them. Has not the covenant of the Book been taken from them that they shall not say concerning God anything except the truth, and they have studied what is in it? And the Last House is better for the godfearing; so will you not understand? ",
  "en_tr_sher": "Then there came after them an evil generation who inherited the Book. They take the paltry goods of this low world and say, 'It will be forgiven us.' But if there came to them similar goods again, they would take them. Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them, that they would not say of God anything but the truth? And they have studied what is therein. And the abode of the Hereafter is better for those who are righteous. Will you not then understand.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And they have been succeeded by [new] generations who &ndash; [in spite of] having inherited the divine writ &ndash; clutch but at the fleeting good of this lower world and say, \"We shall be forgiven,\" the while they are ready, if another such fleeting good should come their way, to clutch at it [and sin again]. Have they not been solemnly pledged through the divine writ not to attribute unto God aught but what is true, and [have they not] read again and again all that is therein? \nSince the life in the hereafter is the better [of the two] for all who are conscious of God &ndash; will you not, then, use your reason?",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And there succeeded after them a succession who inherited the Book, taking the chance goods of this lower world, and saying, It will be forgiven us; and if chance goods the like of them come to them, they will take them. Has not the compact of the Book been taken touching them, that they should say concerning God nothing but the truth? And they have studied what is in it; and the Last Abode is better for those who are godfearing. Do you not understand?",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Then others succeeded them who inherited the scriptures, and yet kept themselves occupied in acquiring the goods of this world and kept saying: 'We shall be forgiven.' And when there comes to them an opportunity for acquiring more of those goods, they seize it.{{129}} Was not the covenant of the Book taken from them that they would not ascribe to Allah anything but the truth?
