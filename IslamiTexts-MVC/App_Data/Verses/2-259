  "en_tr_yusuf": "Or (take) the similitude of one who passed by a hamlet, all in ruins to its roofs. He said: \"Oh! how shall Allah bring it (ever) to life, after (this) its death?\" but Allah caused him to die for a hundred years, then raised him up (again).

Then have a look at your ass, (and see that his very bones have become rotten) and We have done this in order to make you a Sign for the people.{{295}} Look, how We raise up the skeleton and set the bones (of the ass) and cover them with flesh and (put breath of life into them).\" And when the Reality became manifest to him, he said, \"I know that Allah has power over everything.\"",

As to (1), there are only four words in this verse about bones. As to (2) and (3), there is nothing specific to connect this verse with either. The wording is perfectly general, and we must understand it as general. I think it does refer not only to individual, but to national death and resurrection."

But Allah can cause resurrection as He has done many times in history, and as He will do at the final Resurrection. Time is nothing before Allah. The doubter thinks that he has been dead or \"tarried thus\" a day or less when the period has been a century. On the other hand, the food and drink which he left behind is intact, and as fresh as it was when he left it. But the donkey is not only dead, but nothing but bones is left of it. And before the man's eyes, the bones are reunited, clothed with flesh and blood, and restored to life. Moral: (1) Time is nothing to Allah; (2) It affects different things in different ways; (3) The keys of life and death are in Allah's hands; (4) Man's power is nothing; his faith should be in Allah."
