Among the Christians, too, the Faith slowly won ground. Embassies were sent by the Holy Prophet in the 6th and 7th years of the Hijrah to all the principal countries around Arabia, viz., the capital of the Byzantine Empire (Constantinople), the capital of the Persian Empire (Mada'in), the Sasanian capital known to the West by the Greek name of Ctesiphon, (about thirty miles south of modem Baghdad), Syria, Abyssinia, and Egypt. All these (except Persia) were Christian countries. In the same connection, an embassy was also sent to Yamamah in Arabia itself (east of the Hijaz) where the Banu Hanifah tribe was Christian, like the Harith tribe of Najran who voluntarily sent an embassy to Madman. All these countries except Abyssinia eventually became Muslim, and Abyssinia itself has a considerable Muslim population now and sent some Muslim converts to Madinah in the time of the Prophet himself. As a generalisation, it is true that the Jewish and the Christian peoples as they existed in the seventh century of the Christian era have been mainly absorbed by Islam, as well as the lands in which they predominated. Remnants of them built up new nuclei. The Roman Catholic Church conquered new lands among the northern (Germanic) Pagans and the Byzantine Church among the eastern (Slavonic) Pagans, and the Protestantism of the 16th century gave a fresh stimulus to the main ideas for which Islam stands, viz., the abolition of priestcraft, the right of private judgement, the simplification of ritual, and the insistence upon the simple, practical, everyday duties of life."
