  "ar_text_clean": "وكذلك زين لكثير من المشركين قتل أولادهم شركاؤهم ليردوهم وليلبسوا عليهم دينهم ولو شاء الله ما فعلوه فذرهم وما يفترون",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Even so, in the eyes of most of the pagans, their \"partners\" made alluring the slaughter of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction, and cause confusion in their religion. If Allah had willed, they would not have done so: But leave alone them and their inventions.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Thus have their (so-called) partners (of Allah) made the killing of their children to seem fair unto many of the idolaters, that they may ruin them and make their faith obscure for them. Had Allah willed (it otherwise), they had not done so. So leave them alone with their devices.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And thus their associates have made fair seeming to most of the polytheists the killing of their children, that they may cause them to perish and obscure for them their religion; and if Allah had pleased, they would not have done it, therefore leave them and that which they forge.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And so to many of the Mushrikun (polytheists - see V.2:105) their (Allah's so-called) \"partners\" have made fair-seeming the killing of their children, in order to lead them to their own destruction and cause confusion in their religion. And if Allah had willed they would not have done so. So leave them alone with their fabrications.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And even so their associate-gods have made fair seeming unto many of the associaters the slaying of their offspring, so that they may cause them to perish and that they may confound unto them their religion. And had Allah so willed, they would not have done it. Wherefore let thou alone them and that which they fabricate.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "As such their associates made it attractive to the idolaters to kill their children so that they ruin them and confuse them about their religion. But had Allah willed, they would not have done so. Therefore, leave them to their false inventions.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And like that, for many of the idolaters their associate-gods have made killing of their children seem fair so as to annihilate them, and to confuse their religion for them; and had God willed, they would not have done it; so leave them and what they forge.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And in the like manner have their associate-gods made the slaying of their children seem fair to many of the idolaters that they may ruin them and cause confusion in their religion. And if God had enforced His will, they would not have done this; so leave them alone with that which they invent.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And, likewise, their belief in beings or powers that are supposed to have a share in God's divinity makes [even] the slaying of their children seem goodly to many of those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God, thus bringing them to ruin and confusing them in their faith. \nYet, unless God had so willed, they would not be doing all this: stand, therefore, aloof from them and all their false imagery!",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Thus those associates of theirs have decked out fair to many idolaters to slay their children, to destroy them, and to confuse their religion for them. Had God willed, they would not have done so; so leave them to their forging.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And, likewise, the beings supposed to have a share in Allah's divinity have made the slaying of their offspring seem lawful to many of those who associate others with Allah in His divinity{{107}} so that they may ruin them{{108}} and confound them regarding their faith.{{109}} If Allah had so willed, they would not have done that. Leave them alone to persist in their fabrication. {{110}}",
