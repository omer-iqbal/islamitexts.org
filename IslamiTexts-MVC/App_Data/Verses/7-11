The reference to all mankind which precedes the story of Adam in this surah makes it clear that his name symbolizes, in this context, the whole human race. Western scholars usually take it for granted that the name \"Iblis\" is a corruption of the Greek word diabolos, from which the English \"devil\" is derived. There is, however, not the slightest evidence that the pre-Islamic Arabs borrowed this or any other mythological term from the Greeks - while on the other hand, it is established that the Greeks derived a good deal of their mythological concepts (including various deities and their functions) from the much earlier South-Arabian civilization (cf. Encyclopaedia of Islam I, 379 f.). One may, therefore, assume with something approaching certainty that the Greek diabolos is a Hellenized form of the Arabic name for the Fallen Angel, which, in turn, is derived from the root-verb ablasa, \"he despaired\" or \"gave up hope\" or \"became broken in spirit\" (see Lane I, 248). The fact that the noun diabolos (\"slanderer\" - derived from the verb diaballein, \"to throw [something] across\") is of genuinely Greek origin does not, by itself, detract anything from this hypothesis: for it is conceivable that the Greeks, with their well-known tendency to Hellenize foreign names, identified the name \"Iblis\" with the, to them, much more familiar term diabolos. - As regards Iblis' statement, in the next verse, that he had been created \"out of fire\", see surah 38. note 60."
