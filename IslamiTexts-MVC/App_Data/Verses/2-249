  "en_tr_yusuf": "When Talut set forth with the armies, he said: \"Allah will test you at the stream: if any drinks of its water, He goes not with my army: Only those who taste not of it go with me: A mere sip out of the hand is excused.\" but they all drank of it, except a few. When they crossed the river,- He and the faithful ones with him,- they said: \"This day We cannot cope with Goliath and his forces.\" but those who were convinced that they must meet Allah, said: \"How oft, by Allah's will, Hath a small force vanquished a big one? Allah is with those who steadfastly persevere.\"",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And when Saul set out with the army, he said: Lo! Allah will try you by (the ordeal of) a river. Whosoever therefore drinketh thereof he is not of me, and whosoever tasteth it not he is of me, save him who taketh (thereof) in the hollow of his hand. But they drank thereof, all save a few of them. And after he had crossed (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: We have no power this day against Goliath and his hosts. But those who knew that they would meet Allah exclaimed: How many a little company hath overcome a mighty host by Allah's leave! Allah is with the steadfast.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "So when Talut departed with the forces, he said: Surely Allah will try you with a river; whoever then drinks from it, he is not of me, and whoever does not taste of it, he is surely of me, except he who takes with his hand as much of it as fills the hand; but with the exception of a few of them they drank from it. So when he had crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said: We have today no power against Jalut and his forces. Those who were sure that they would meet their Lord said: How often has a small party vanquished a numerous host by Allah's permission, and Allah is with the patient.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Then when Talut (Saul) set out with the army, he said: \"Verily! Allah will try you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof, he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in the hollow of his hand.\" Yet, they drank thereof, all, except a few of them. So when he had crossed it (the river), he and those who believed with him, they said: \"We have no power this day against Jalut (Goliath) and his hosts.\" But those who knew with certainty that they were to meet their Lord, said: \"How often a small group overcame a mighty host by Allah's Leave?\" And Allah is with As-Sabirin (the patient ones, etc.).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Then when Talut sallied forth with the hosts, he said, verily God will prove you with a river: then whosoever drinketh thereof shall be none of mine, and whosoever tasteth it not, verily shall be mine, excepting him who ladeth a lading with his hand. But they drank thereof, save a few of them. Then when he had crossed it, he,and those who believe with him, they said: We have no strength to-day against Jalut and his hosts. But those who imagined that they were going to meet Allah Said how oft hath a small party prevailed against a large party by God's leave! And Allah is with the patiently persevering.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "And when Saul marched out with his army, he said: 'Allah will test you with a river. He who drinks from it shall cease to be one of mine but he who does not drink from it, except he who scoops up once with his hand, shall be of mine. ' But for a few of them, they all drank from it. And when he had crossed it with those who believed, they said: 'We have no power this day against Goliath and his soldiers. ' But those of them who reckoned they would meet Allah replied: 'Many a small band has, by the permission of Allah, vanquished a mighty army. Allah is with the patient. '",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "So when Saul went forth with the hosts, he said, `God will try you at a river; then whoso drinks out of it is not of me, and whoso does not take it is of me, except that any takes a handful with his hand'; but they drank out of it, except a few of them; and when he crossed it, he and those who believed with him, they said, `we have no power today against Goliath and his hosts'; those, who reckoned that they would be meeting God, said, `how often a small company has overcome a large company by the leave of God, and God is with the steadfast.'",
  "en_tr_sher": "And when Talut set out with the forces, he said, 'Surely, God will try you with a river. So he who drinks therefrom is not of me; and he who taste it not is assuredly of me, save him who takes only a handful of water with his hand.' But they drank of it, except a few of them. And when they crossed it -- he and those who believed along with him -- they said, 'We have no power today against Jalut and his forces.' But those who knew for certain that they would one day meet God, said, 'How many a small party has triumphed over a large party by God's command! And God is with the steadfast.'",
  "en_tr_asad": "And when Saul set out with his forces, he said: \"Behold, God will now try you by a river: he who shall drink of it will not belong to me, whereas he who shall refrain from tasting it &ndash; he, indeed, will belong to me; but forgiven shall be he who shall scoop up but single handful.\" \nHowever, save for a few of them, they all drank [their fill] of it.\nAnd as soon as he and those who had kept faith with him had crossed the river, the others said: \"No strength have we today [to stand up] against Goliath and his forces!\"\n[Yet] those who knew with certainty that they were destined to meet God, replied: \"How often has a small host overcome a great host by God's leave! For God is with those who are patient in adversity.\"",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And when Saul went forth with the hosts he said, God will try you with a river; whosoever drinks of it is not of me, and whoso tastes it flot, he is of me, saving him who scoops up with his hand. But they drank of it, except a few of them; and when he crossed it, and those who believed with him, they said, We have no power today against Goliath and his hosts. Said those who reckoned they should meet God, How often a little company has overcome a numerous company, by Gods leave! And God is with the patient.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And when Saul marched out with his army, he warned: \"Allah is going to put you to a test by the side of a river: whoso drinks of its water shall cease to be my companion: he alone shall be my companion who does not quench his thirst with its water: one may, however, take except a few, drank their fill of it.{{271}} Afterwards when Saul, and those who had believed with him, crossed the river and advanced forward, the former said to Saul, \"We have no power left this day to fight against Goliath and his hosts.\"{{272}} But those who believed that one Day they shall meet Allah, declared, \"It has often been that a small host has, by Allah's grace, overcome a big host: for Allah is with those who show fortitude.\"",
