Some of the commentators assume that the word fath (lit., \"victory\" or \"triumph\") occurring in this sentence is a prophetic reference to the conquest of Mecca by the Muslims. This assumption, however, cannot be correct since Mecca was already in the hands of the Muslims at the time of the revelation of this surah. Hence, the term fath has obviously been used here in its primary significance of \"opening\" - namely, the opening of good fortune.

The \"other event of God's own devising\" may conceivably refer to a divine punishment of the hypocrites apart from the good fortune that might be in store for the true believers."
