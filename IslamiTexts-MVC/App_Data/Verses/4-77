  "en_tr_yusuf": "Hast thou not turned Thy vision to those who were told to hold back their hands (from fight) but establish regular prayers and spend in regular charity? When (at length) the order for fighting was issued to them, behold! a section of them feared men as - or even more than - they should have feared Allah: They said: \"Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordered us to fight? Wouldst Thou not Grant us respite to our (natural) term, near (enough)?\" Say: \"Short is the enjoyment of this world: the Hereafter is the best for those who do right: Never will ye be dealt with unjustly in the very least!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Hast thou not seen those unto whom it was said: Withhold your hands, establish worship and pay the poordue, but when fighting was prescribed for them behold! a party of them fear mankind even as their fear of Allah or with greater fear, and say: Our Lord! Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us? If only Thou wouldst give us respite yet a while! Say (unto them, O Muhammad): The comfort of this world is scant; the Hereafter will be better for him who wardeth off (evil); and ye will not be wronged the down upon a date-stone.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Have you not seen those to whom it was said: Withhold your hands, and keep up prayer and pay the poor-rate; but when fighting is prescribed for them, lo! a party of them fear men as they ought to have feared Allah, or (even) with a greater fear, and say: Our Lord! why hast Thou ordained fighting for us?

Say: The provision of this world is short, and the hereafter is better for him who guards (against evil); and you shall not be wronged the husk of a date stone.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Have you not seen those who were told to hold back their hands (from fighting) and perform As- Salat (Iqamat-as-Salat), and give Zakat, but when the fighting was ordained for them, behold! a section of them fear men as they fear Allah or even more. They say: \"Our Lord! Why have you ordained for us fighting? Would that you had granted us respite for a short period?\" Say: \"Short is the enjoyment of this world. The Hereafter is (far) better for him who fears Allah, and you shall not be dealt with unjustly even equal to the Fatila (a scalish thread in the long slit of a date-stone).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Hast thou not observed those unto whom it was said; . withhold your hands, and establish prayer and give the poor-rate; but when thereafter fighting was prescribed unto them, lo! there is a party of them dreading men as with the dread of Allah, or with greater dread; and they say: our Lord! why hast Thou prescribed unto us fighting! Wouldst that Thou hadst let us tarry a term nearby! Say thou: the enjoyment of the world is little, and the Hereafter is better for him who feareth God; and ye shall not be wronged a whit.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Have you not seen those to whom it has been said: 'Restrain your hands, establish your prayers and pay the obligatory charity. ' Then, as soon as fighting is written for them, there is a party of them fearing people as they would fear Allah, or with stronger fear. And they say: 'Our Lord, why have You written fighting for us, why not postpone us to a near term? ' Say: 'The pleasure of this life is little. The Everlasting Life is better for the cautious. You shall not be wronged a single tissue (of the fine skin that covers a date stone).",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Hast thou not considered those to whom it was said, `restrain your hands, and establish the Prayer, and pay the Due-alms?' Then when fighting was prescribed for them, a party of them feared people as God is feared or with a greater fear; and they said, `our Lord, why hast Thou prescribed fighting for us?

  "en_tr_asad": "ART THOU NOT aware of those who have been told, \"Curb your hands, and be constant in prayer, and render the purifying dues\"?

Why hast Thou ordained fighting for us?

  "en_tr_arberry": "Hast thou not regarded those to whom it was said, Restrain your hands, and perform the prayer, and pay the alms?

Why did You not grant us a little more respite?' Say to them: 'There is little enjoyment in this world. The World to Come is much better for the God-fearing.
