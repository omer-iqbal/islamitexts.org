My rendering of the phrase \"that He should cause people to go astray\" as \"condemn people for going astray\" is based on the interpretation given to it by some of the greatest classical commentators (e.g., Tabari, Razi). As regards the phrase, \"after He has guided them\", Razi interprets it as meaning \"after He has invited them to the way of rectitude (ar-rushd)\"."

However, Razi advances also an alternative interpretation of verse 115, suggesting that it is meant to explain the severity with which the whole of this surah condemns the deniers of the truth and the hypocrites who are going astray after God \"has made clear unto them of what they should beware\". (See in this connection 6:131-132 and the corresponding notes.) This interpretation is, to my mind, the more plausible of the two, and particularly so in view of the sequence (verse 116)."
