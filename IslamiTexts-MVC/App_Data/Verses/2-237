  "ar_text_clean": "وإن طلقتموهن من قبل أن تمسوهن وقد فرضتم لهن فريضة فنصف ما فرضتم إلا أن يعفون أو يعفو الذي بيده عقدة النكاح وأن تعفوا أقرب للتقوى ولا تنسوا الفضل بينكم إن الله بما تعملون بصير",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man's half) is remitted by him in whose hands is the marriage tie; and the remission (of the man's half) is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget Liberality between yourselves. For Allah sees well all that ye do.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "If ye divorce them before ye have touched them and ye have appointed unto them a portion, then (pay the) half of that which ye appointed, unless they (the women) agree to forgo it, or he agreeth to forgo it in whose hand is the marriage tie. To forgo is nearer to piety. And forget not kindness among yourselves. Allah is Seer of what ye do.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And if you divorce them before you have touched them and you have appointed for them a portion, then (pay to them) ha!f of what you have appointed, unless they relinquish or he should relinquish in whose hand is the marriage tie; and it is nearer to righteousness that you should relinquish; and do not neglect the giving of free gifts between you; surely Allah sees what you do.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And if you divorce them before you have touched (had a sexual relation with) them, and you have appointed unto them the Mahr (bridal money given by the husbands to his wife at the time of marriage), then pay half of that (Mahr), unless they (the women) agree to forego it, or he (the husband), in whose hands is the marriage tie, agrees to forego and give her full appointed Mahr. And to forego and give (her the full Mahr) is nearer to At-Taqwa (piety, right-eousness, etc.). And do not forget liberality between yourselves. Truly, Allah is All-Seer of what you do.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And if ye divorce them ere ye have touched them but have settled unto them a settlement, then due from you is half of that which ye have settled unless the wives forego, or he in whose hand is the wedding-knot foregoeth, and that ye should forego is nigher unto piety. And forget not grace amongst yourself; verily of that which ye work Allah is the Beholder.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "If you divorce them before you have touched them but after their dowry has been determined, give them half of what you determined, unless they pardon, or he pardons in whose hand is the marriage knot. And if you pardon it is nearer to wardingoff (evil). Do not forget the generosity between each other. Allah is the Seer of what you do.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And if you divorce them before you have touched them, but you have appointed a marriage- portion for them, then one half of what you have appointed, unless they forgo, or he in whose hand is the marriage-knot forgoes it; and that you forgo is nearer to godfearing; and do not forget to be bountiful to one another; surely God sees the things you do.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And if you divorce them before you have touched them, but have settled upon them a dowry, then half of what you have settled shall be due from you, unless they remit, or he, in whose hands is the tie of marriage, should remit. And that you should remit is nearer to righteousness. And do not forget to do good to one another. Surely God sees what you do.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And if you divorce them before having touched them, but after having settled a dower upon them, then [give them] half of what you have settled &ndash; unless it be that they forgo their claim or he in whose hand is the marriage-tie forgoes his claim [to half of the dower]: and to forgo what is due to you is more in accord with God-consciousness. And forget not [that you are to act with] grace towards one another: verily, God sees all that you do.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And if you divorce them before you have touched them, and you have already appointed for them a marriage-portion, then one-half of what you have appointed, unless it be they make remission, or he makes remission in whose hand is the knot of marriage; yet that you should remit is nearer to godfearing. Forget not to be bountiful one towards another. Surely God sees the things you do.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "In case you fixed a dower for them and then divorced them before you touched them, you should pay half of the fixed dower. But there is no harm if the woman agrees to forego it or the man, in whose hands is the marriage tie, is generous enough (to pay the dower in full). And if you (men) act generously, it is akin to piety. Do not forget to show generosity in your dealings{{261}} with one another for Allah sees what you do.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "And if ye divorce them before consummation, but after the fixation of a dower for them, then the half of the dower (Is due to them), unless they remit it or (the man?s half) is remitted{{269}} by him in whose hands is the marriage tie;{{270}} and the remission (of the man?s half) is the nearest to righteousness. And do not forget Liberality between yourselves. For Allah sees well all that ye do.",
  "en_ctr_asad": "And if you divorce them before having touched them, but after having settled a dower upon them, then [give them] half of what you have settled - unless it be that they forgo their claim or he in whose hand is the marriage-tie{{226}} forgoes his claim [to half of the dower]: and to forgo what is due to you is more in accord with God-consciousness. And forget not [that you are to act with] grace towards one another: verily, God sees all that you do.",
