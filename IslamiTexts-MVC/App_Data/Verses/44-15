He gives them a little trial, perhaps personal, perhaps economic, to see if that would bring them to their bearings, and train their will in the right direction. Some are thus reclaimed, and some do not learn. Perhaps, for the latter, He gives them a chance by removing the trial; some are reclaimed, and some still remain obdurate. And so, in His wisdom, He allows His grace to work, again and again, until, at the last, Judgement must seize the last and irreclaimable remnant \"with a mighty onslaught\".<br/>Such working of Allah's Providence is clearly visible in the story of Quraysh. It is a pity that the economic conditions of Makkah have not been studied in detail in any of the standard biographies of the Prophet. The so-called biographies by non- Muslims, e.g., Muir's Life, do not even mention any Makkan famine or its reactions on Quraysh mind!"
