Then let him see whether his strategy dispelleth that whereat he rageth!.",

Most Commentators are agreed that the pronoun \"him\" in the second line (\"will not help him\") refers to the Prophet, and that the \"any\" in the first line refers to his enemies, who wished to see him destroyed and removed from the scene of his labours, Ibn 'Abbas, whom I have followed here, and whom a great number of Commentators follow, construes the later clauses in the sense given in the text. Freely paraphrased, it means: if the enemies of Allah's Messenger are enraged at his successes, let them fix a rope to their ceiling and hang themselves. Sama 1 is thus rendered by the word \"ceiling\". If Sama'' is rendered by the word \"heaven\" (the usual meaning), the paraphrase would be: if the enemies of Allah's Messenger are enraged at the help he gets from heavens, let them stretch a rope to heaven and see if they can cut off the help that way!-in other words, they are fools if they think they can intercept Allah's help by their petty devices!"
