The term qawl - similar to the term kalimah (see note 36 above) - denoteo, beyond its primary meaning of \"saying\" or \"utterance\", also anything that can be defined as a statement of belief or opinion, namely, \"concept\", \"tenet\", \"assertion of faith\", and so on. In this context it expresses the concept that there is no deity save God, and that Muhammad is His Apostle: which is an interpretation of the above phrase given by the Prophet himself, as quoted by Bukhari in a Tradition on the authority of Al-Bara' ibn 'Azib (Kitab at-Tafsir), and by other Traditionists, including Muslim, on the authority of Shu'bah. The adjective thabit connotes the \"firmness\" - that is, the unshakable truth - of the \"word\" (or \"concept\",) which it qualifies, thus connecting it with the preceding parable of the \"good word\" and the \"good tree\"."
