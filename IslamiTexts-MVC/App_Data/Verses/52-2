The five Signs to which appeal is made are: (1) the Mount (of Revelation), (verse 1; (2) the Decree Inscribed, verses 2-3; (3) The Muchfrequented Fane, verse 4; (4) the Canopy Raised High, verse 5; and (5) the Ocean filled with Swell, verse 6.<br/>Let us examine these in detail. Each of them has a figurative and a mystic meaning. (1) The Mount is the sublime world of Revelation. In the case of Moses it is typified by Mount Sinai: Cf. 95:2, where it is mentioned in juxtaposition to the sacred territory of Makkah, 95:3. In the case of Jesus it is the Mount of Olives : Cf. 95:1, and also Matt. 24:3-51, where Jesus made his striking pronouncement about the Judgement to come. In the case of Muhammad, it is the Mountain of Light, where the divine inspiration made him one with the spiritual world: Cf. C. 31, and n. 11 (2). The Decree Inscribed is Allah's Eternal Decree. When it becomes Revelation to man, it is further described as \"inscribed\", reduced to writing; and as it is made clear to the intelligence of man, it is further described as \"in a scroll unfolded\", that is, spread out so that everyone who has the will can seek its guidance."
