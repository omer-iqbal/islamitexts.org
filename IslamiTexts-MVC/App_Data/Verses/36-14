      "note": "Allah sends His messengers or teachers of Truth by ones and twos, and where the opposition is great and He considers it necessary, he supports them with others. Their mission is divine, but they do not claim to be more than men. This is used by the unjust and the ungodly as if it were a reproach, whereas it should commend them to men, for mankind is glorified by such commission and by Allah's Self-revelation. The Message is clearly expressed in human language, but because it exposes all evil, men think it unlucky, as it checks their selfishness. It is often the poorest and most despised of mankind, from the outskirts or \"farthest parts of the City\", that accept the Message and are willing to work and die for it. The stiff-necked resist and accomplish their own destruction."

      "note": "As is usual with such passages, the commentators advance various speculations as to the \"identity\" of the town and the apostles. Since, however, the story is clearly described as a parable, it must be understood as such and not as an histoncal narrative. It seems to me that we have here an allegory of the three great monotheistic religions, successively propounded by Moses, Jesus and Muhammad, and embodying, essentially, the same spiritual truths. The \"township\" (qaryah) mentioned in the parable represents, I think, the common cultural environment within which these three religions appeared. The apostles of the first two are said to have been sent \"together\", implying that the teachings of both were - and are - anchored in one and the same scripture, the Old Testament of the Bible. When, in the course of time, their impact proved insufficient to mould the ethical attitude of the people or peoples concerned, God \"strengthened\" them by means of His final message, conveyed to the world by the third and last of the apostles, Muhammad."
