  "en_tr_pickth": "Bethink you: If it is from Allah and ye disbelieve therein, and a witness of the Children of Israel hath already testified to the like thereof and hath believed, and ye are too proud (what plight is yours)? Lo! Allah guideth not wrong-doing folk.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Say: Have you considered if it is from Allah, and you disbelieve in it, and a witness from among the children of Israel has borne witness of one like it, so he believed, while you are big with pride; surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.",

If this (Qur'an) is from Allah, and you deny it, and a witness from among the Children of Israel ('Abdullah bin Salam radhiallahu'anhu) testifies that this Qur'an is from Allah [like the Taurat (Torah)], so he believed (embraced Islam) while you are too proud (to believe).\" Verily! Allah guides not the people who are Zalimun (polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doing).",
