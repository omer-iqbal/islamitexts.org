Although parts of the Qur'an should be recited in every prayer, the early morning prayer is metonymically singled out as the \"recitation (qur'an) at dawn\" because the Prophet, under divine inspiration, used to lengthen his recitation while praying at that time, thus stressing the special significance of this particular prayer.
