This allegorical reference to the delights of paradise occurs in the Qur'an three times (apart from the above instance, which is chronologically the earliest, in 37:48 and 55:56 as well). As an allegory, this phrase evidently applies to the righteous of both sexes, who in the life to come will be rejoined with those whom they loved and by whom they were loved in this world: for, \"God has promised the believers, both men and women, gardens through which running waters flow, therein to abide, and goodly dwellings in gardens of perpetual bliss\" (9:72); and, \"anyone - be it man or woman - who does [whatever he can] of good deeds and is a believer withal, shall enter paradise\" (4:124, with similar statements in 16:97 and 40:40). Finally, we are told in 36:56 that in this paradise \"will they and their spouses on couches recline\" - i.e., will find peace and inner fulfilment with and in one another.
