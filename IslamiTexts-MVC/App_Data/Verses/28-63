This \"answer\" is, of course, evasive, but it is quoted here to show that man's attachment to false - but, nevertheless, almost deified - values and concepts based on stark materialism is, more often than not, a matter of \"social continuity\": in other words, the validity of those materialistic pseudo-values is taken for granted simply because they are time-honoured, with every generation blindly subscribing to the views held by their forebears. In its deepest sense, this passage - as so many similar ones throughout the Qur'an - points to the moral inadmissibility of accepting an ethical or intellectual proposition as true on no other grounds than that it was held to be true by earlier generations."
