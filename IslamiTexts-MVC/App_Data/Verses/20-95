The lesson of the whole of this episode is the fall of a human soul that nominally comes to Allah's Truth in a humble position but makes mischief when and as it finds occasion. It is no less dangerous and culpable than the arrogant soul, typified by pharaoh, which gets into high places and makes its leadership the cause of ruin of a whole nation."
