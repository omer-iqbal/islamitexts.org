Here the point is that there is another type of man to whom the goodness of Allah is made clear by rain and the gifts of nature and who realises the daily, seasonal, and secular changes which evidence Allah's goodness in giving us life (physical and spiritual) and reviving us after we seem to die,-and who yet fails to draw the right conclusion from it and to make his own life true and beautiful, so that when his period of probation in this transitory life is ended, he can enter into his eternal heritage. Having come so far such men fail at the crucial stage. At that stage they ought to have praised and glorified Allah, and accepted His Grace and Light, but they show their want of true understanding by failing to profit by Allah's gifts."
