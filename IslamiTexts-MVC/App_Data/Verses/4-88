  "en_tr_yusuf": "Why should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "What aileth you that ye are become two parties regarding the hypocrites, when Allah cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they earned? Seek ye to guide him whom Allah hath sent astray? He whom Allah sendeth astray, for him thou (O MUhammad) canst not find a road.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "What is the matter with you, then, that you have become two parties about the hypocrites, while Allah has made them return (to unbelief) for what they have earned? Do you wish to guide him whom Allah has caused to err? And whomsoever Allah causes to err, you shall by no means find a way for him.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Then what is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties about the hypocrites? Allah has cast them back (to disbelief) because of what they have earned. Do you want to guide him whom Allah has made to go astray? And he whom Allah has made to go astray, you will never find for him any way (of guidance).",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "What aileth you then, that ye are two parties regarding the hypocrites? whereas Allah hath reverted them because of that which they have earned. Would ye lead aright those whom Allah hath sent astray? And whomsoever Allah sendeth astray, for him thou shalt not find a way.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "What is the matter with you that you are two parties concerning the hypocrites when Allah has overthrown them for what they earned? Would you desire to guide those whom Allah has caused to be led astray? Whosoever Allah leads astray, you will not find for him a way.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "But how is it with you that you are two parties concerning the hypocrites, when God has overturned them for what they have earned? Do you desire to guide him whom God has sent astray? But whomso God sends astray, thou wilt not find a way for him.",
  "en_tr_sher": "What is the matter with you that you are divided into two parties regarding the Hypocrites? And God has overthrown them because of what they earned. Desire ye to guide him whom God has caused to perish? And for him whom God causes to perish thou shalt not find a way.",
  "en_tr_asad": "How, then, could you be of two minds about the hypocrites, seeing that God [Himself] has disowned them because of their guilt? Do you, perchance, seek to guide those whom God has let go astray &ndash; when for him whom God lets go astray thou canst never find any way?",
  "en_tr_arberry": "How is it with you, that you are two parties touching the hypocrites, and God has overthrown them for what they earned? What, do you desire to guide him whom God has led astray? Whom God leads astray, thou wilt not find for him a way.",

      "note": "When the desertion of the hypocrites at Uhud nearly caused a disaster to the Muslim cause there was great feeling among the Muslims of Madinah against them. One party wanted to put them to the sword: another to leave them alone. The actual policy pursued avoided both extremes, and was determined by these verses. It was clear that they were a danger to the Muslim, community if they were admitted into its counsels, and in any case they were a source of demoralisation. But while every caution was used, no extreme measures were taken against them. On the contrary, they were given a chance of making good. If they made a sacrifice for the cause (\"flee from what is forbidden,\" see next verse), their conduct purged their previous cowardice, and their sincerity entitled them to be taken back. But if they deserted the Muslim community again, they were treated as enemies, with the additional penalty of desertion which is enforced by all nations actually at war. Even so, a humane exception was made in the two cases specified in 4:90."

There are various conjectures, almost all of them of a historical nature, as to the identity of these hypocrites. Some of the commentators think that the verse refers to the hypocrites at Medina in the early years after the hijrah; others (e.g., Tabari) prefer the view expressed by Ibn 'Abbas, according to whom this refers to certain people of Mecca who, before the hijrah, outwardly accepted Islam but secretly continued to support the pagan Quraysh. It seems to me, however, that there is no need to search after \"historical\" interpretations of the above verse, since it can easily be understood in general terms. The preceding verse speaks of God, and stresses His oneness and the obvious truth inherent in His revealed message, as well as the certainty of judgment on Resurrection Day. \"How, then,\" continues the argument, \"could you be of two minds regarding the moral stature of people who go so far as to pay lip-service to the truth of God's message and are, nevertheless, not willing to make a sincere choice between right and wrong?\""
