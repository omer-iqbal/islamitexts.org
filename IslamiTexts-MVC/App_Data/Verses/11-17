  "ar_text_clean": "أفمن كان على بينة من ربه ويتلوه شاهد منه ومن قبله كتاب موسى إماما ورحمة أولئك يؤمنون به ومن يكفر به من الأحزاب فالنار موعده فلا تك في مرية منه إنه الحق من ربك ولكن أكثر الناس لا يؤمنون",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guide and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe!",
  "en_tr_pickth": "Is he (to be counted equal with them) who relieth on a clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him reciteth it, and before it was the Book of Moses, an example and a mercy? Such believe therein, and whoso disbelieveth therein of the clans, the Fire is his appointed place. So be not thou in doubt concerning it. Lo! it is the Truth from thy Lord; but most of mankind believe not.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "Is he then who has with him clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it and before it (is) the Book of Musa, a guide and a mercy? These believe in it; and whoever of the (different) parties disbelieves in it, surely it is the truth from your Lord, but most men do not believe.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "Can they (Muslims) who rely on a clear proof (the Qur'an) from their Lord, and whom a witness [Prophet Muhammad SAW through Jibrael (Gabriel] from Him follows it (can they be equal with the disbelievers); and before it, came the Book of Musa (Moses), a guidance and a mercy, they believe therein, but those of the sects (Jews, Christians and all the other non-Muslim nations) that reject it (the Qur'an), the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. So be not in doubt about it (i.e. those who denied Prophet Muhammad SAW and also denied all that which he brought from Allah, surely, they will enter Hell). Verily, it is the truth from your Lord, but most of the mankind believe not.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Is he like unto him who resteth upon an evidence from His Lord, so and there rehearseth it a witness from Him And before it was the Book of Musa, a pattern and a mercy; these believe therein; and whosoever of the sects disbelieveth therein, the Fire is his promised place. Be then thou not in dubitation thereof, verily it is the truth from thy Lord, yet most of the mankind believe not.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Then what of he who stands upon a clear proof from his Lord, recited by a witness from Him and before him is the Book of Moses for a guide and a mercy? Those believe in it. But as for those partisans who disbelieve in it, their promised land shall be the Fire. Therefore do not doubt it. It is the truth from your Lord, yet most people do not believe.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Is then he who is on a clear proof from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it, and before him was the Book of Moses for a guide and a mercy? Those believe in it. But whoso out of the factions disbelieves in it, the Fire is his promised place. So be thou not in doubt about it; it is the truth from thy Lord, but most men believe not.",
  "en_tr_sher": "Can he, then, who stands upon a clear proof from his Lord, and to testify to whose truth a witness from Him shall follow him, and who was preceded by the Book of Moses, a guide and a mercy, be an impostor? Those who are the true followers of Moses believe therein, and whoever of the opposing parties disbelieve in it, the Fire shall be his promised place. So be not thou, O reader, in doubt about it. Surely, it is the truth from thy Lord; but most men believe not.",
  "en_tr_asad": "Can, then, [he who cares for no more than the life of this world be compared with] one who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Sustainer, conveyed through [this] testimony from Him, as was the revelation vouchsafed to Moses aforetime &ndash; [a divine writ ordained by Him] to be a guidance and grace [unto man]?\nThey [who understand this message &ndash; it is they alone who truly] believe in it; whereas for any of those who, leagued together [in common hostility], deny its truth &ndash; the fire shall be their appointed state [in the life to come].\nAnd so, be not in doubt about this [revelation]: behold, it is the truth from thy Sustainer, even though most people will not believe in it.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "And what of him who stands upon a clear sign from his Lord, and a witness from Him recites it, and before him is the Book of Moses for an ensample and a mercy? Those believe in it; but whosoever disbelieves in it, being one of the partisans, his promised land is the Fire. So be thou not in doubt of it; it is the truth from thy Lord, but most men do not believe.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "Can it happen that he who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Lord,{{17}} subsequently followed by a witness from Him (in his support),{{18}} and prior to that the Book of Moses was revealed as a guide and a mercy, (would even he deny the truth in the manner of those who adore the life of this world)? Rather, such men are bound to believe in it.{{19}} The Fire shall be the promised resort of the groups that disbelieve. So be in no doubt about it for this indeed is the truth from your Lord although most people do not believe.",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Can they be (like) those who accept a Clear (Sign) from their Lord, and whom a witness from Himself{{1512}} doth teach, as did the Book of Moses before it,- a guide{{1513}} and a mercy? They believe therein; but those of the Sects that reject it,- the Fire will be their promised meeting-place. Be not then in doubt thereon: for it is the truth from thy Lord: yet many among men do not believe!",
  "en_ctr_asad": "Can, then, [he who cares for no more than the life of this world be compared with{{28}}] one who takes his stand on a clear evidence from his Sustamer, conveyed through [this] testimony from Him,{{29}} as was the revelation vouchsafed to Moses aforetime - [a divine writ ordained by Him] to be a guidance and grace [unto man]? They [who understand this message - it is they alone who truly] believe in it;{{30}} whereas for any of those who, leagued together [in common hostility],{{31}} deny its truth - the fire shall be their appointed state [in the life to come]. And so,{{32}} be not in doubt about this [revelation]: behold, it is the truth from thy Sustainer, even though{{33}} most people will not believe in it.",
