  "en_tr_yusuf": "Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them, against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast; some We caused the earth to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters): It was not Allah Who injured (or oppressed) them:\" They injured (and oppressed) their own souls.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "So We took each one in his sin; of them was he on whom We sent a hurricane, and of them was he who was overtaken by the (Awful) Cry, and of them was he whom We caused the earth to swallow, and of them was he whom We drowned. It was not for Allah to wrong them, but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "So each We punished for his sin; of them was he on whom We sent down a violent storm, and of them was he whom the rumbling overtook, and of them was he whom We made to be swallowed up by the earth, and of them was he whom We drowned; and it did not beseem Allah that He should be unjust to them, but they were unjust to their own souls.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "So We punished each (of them) for his sins, of them were some on whom We sent Hasiban (a violent wind with shower of stones) [as the people of Lout (Lot)], and of them were some who were overtaken by As-Saihah [torment - awful cry, etc. (as Thamud or Shu'aib's people)], and of them were some whom We caused the earth to swallow [as Qarun (Korah)], and of them were some whom We drowned [as the people of Nuh (Noah), or Fir'aun (Pharaoh) and his people]. It was not Allah Who wronged them, but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "Wherefore each We laid hold of for his sin. Of them were some on whom We sent a violent wind; and of them were some - who were overtaken by a shout; and of them were some - with whom We sank the earth; and of them were some - whom We drowned. Allah was not such as to wrong them, but themselves they were wont to wrong.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Each of them We seized for his sin. On some We loosed a squall of pebbles, and others were seized by the Cry. Some We caused to be swallowed up by the earth, and some We drowned. Allah would never wrong them but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "Everyone We seized, for his offence; on some We loosed a violent storm of gravel; and some, the Cry seized; and some We made the earth to swallow; and some We drowned; and God was not such as would wrong them, but themselves they wronged.",
  "en_tr_sher": "So each one of them We seized for his sin; of them were those against whom We sent a violent sandstorm, and of them were those whom a roaring blast overtook, and of them were those whom We caused the earth to swallow up, and of them were those whom We drowned. And God did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_asad": "For every one of them did We take to task for his sin: and so, upon some of them We let loose a deadly stormwind; and some of them were overtaken by a [sudden] blast; and some of them We caused to be swallowed by the earth; and some of them We caused to drown. And it was not God who wronged them, but it was they who had wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Each We seized for his sin; and of them against some We loosed a squall of pebbles and some were seized by the Cry, and some We made the earth to swallow, and some We drowned; God would never wrong them, but they wronged themselves.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "So We seized each for their sin. We let loose upon some a violent tornado with showers of stones;{{68}} some were overtaken by a mighty Cry;{{69}} some were caused to be swallowed up by the earth,{{70}} and some We drowned.{{71}} Allah would not wrong them, but it is they who wronged themselves.{{72}}",
  "en_ctr_yusuf": "Each one of them We seized for his crime: of them, against some We sent a violent tornado (with showers{{3462}} of stones); some were caught by a (mighty) Blast;{{3463}} some We caused the earth{{3464}} to swallow up; and some We drowned (in the waters):{{3465}} It was not Allah Who injured (or oppressed) them:\" They injured (and oppressed) their own souls.",
  "en_ctr_asad": "For, every one of them did We take to task for his sin: and so, upon some of them We let loose a deadly storm-wind; and some of them were overtaken by a [sudden] blast;{{36}} and some of them We caused to be swallowed by the earth; and some of them We caused to drown.
