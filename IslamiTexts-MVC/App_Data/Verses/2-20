The expression \"their hearing and their sight\" is obviously a metonym for man's instinctive ability to discern between good and evil and, hence, for his moral responsibility. - In the parable of the \"people who kindle a fire\" we have, I believe, an allusion to some people's exclusive reliance on what is termed the \"scientific approach\" as a means to illumine and explain all the imponderables of life and faith, and the resulting arrogant refusal to admit that anything could be beyond the reach of man's intellect. This \"overweening arrogance\", as the Qur'an terms it, unavoidably exposes its devotees - and the society dominated by them - to the lightning of disillusion which \"well-nigh takes away their sight\", i.e., still further weakens their moral perception and deepens their \"terror of death\"."
