Here the emphasis is on the wonderful nature of the Fire and the wonderful way in which Moses was transformed at the touch of spiritual Light. He was travelling in the Sinai desert with his family. Seeking ordinary light, he came upon a Light which took him to the highest mysteries of Allah. No doubt all his inner history had prepared him for his great destiny. It is the inner history that matters, and not the place of the position of a man in the eyes of his ordinary fellows."
