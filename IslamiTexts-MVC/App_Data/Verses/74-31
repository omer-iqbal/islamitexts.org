There was a great volume of angelology in the religious literature of the People of the Book (i.e., the Jews and Christians) to whom (among others) an appeal is made in this verse. The Essenes, a Jewish brotherhood with highly spiritual ideas, to which perhaps the Prophet Jesus himself belonged, had an extensive literature of angelology. In the Midrash also, which was a Jewish school of exegesis and mystical interpretation, there was much said about angels. The Eastern Christian sects contemporary with the birth of Islam had borrowed and developed many of these ideas, and their mystics owed much to the Gnostics and the Persian apocalyptic systems. In the New Testament the relation of the angels with Fire is referred to more than once. In Rev. 9:11 we have \"the angel of the bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon, but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon\". In Rev. 14:18 there is an \"angel which had power over fire\", and in Rev. 16:8 an angel has \"power . . . given unto him to scorch men with fire\". In the Old Testament (Daniel 7:9-10) me essence of all angels is fire: thousands of them issued as a fiery stream from before the Ancient of Days, whose \"throne was like the fiery flame, and His wheels as burning fire\"."
