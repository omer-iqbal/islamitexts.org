As regards the \"raising of the heavens without any supports\" visible to man, it should be borne in mind that the noun sama' denotes, primarily, \"something that is above [another thing]\", and is used - mostly in its plural form samawat - to describe (a) the visible skies (as well as, occasionally, the clouds), (b) the cosmic space in which the stars, the solar systems (including our own) and the galaxies pursue their course, and (c) the abstract concept of the forces emanating from God (since He is, in the metonymical sense of this word, \"above\" all that exists).
