The past history of his race takes us to the story of the Flood, which is symbolical of the deliverance of man from the forces of nature. Noah's Ark is the symbol of that deliverance. But the symbol still remains as a memorial: the Ark was a \"Sign to all Peoples\"; 29:15. Man's own personal experience is appealed to in every ship afloat; see next note."
