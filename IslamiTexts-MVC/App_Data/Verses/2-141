The argument is that it is wrong to claim a monopoly for Allah's Message: it is the same peoples and in all ages: if it undergoes local variations or variations according to times and seasons those variations pass away. This leads to the argument in the remainder of the Surah that with the renewal of the Message and the birth of a new people, a new symbolism and new ordinances become appropriate, and they are now expounded."
