The curse of Allah is on disbelievers.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And when there came to them a Book from Allah verifying that which they have, and aforetime they used to pray for victory against those who disbelieve, but when there came to them (Prophet) that which they did not recognize, they disbelieved in him; so Allah's curse is on the unbelievers.",

So let the Curse of Allah be on the disbelievers.",

  "en_tr_qarib": "And when a Book came to them from Allah confirming what was with them, while before that they used to pray for victory over the unbelievers when there came to them what they knew, they disbelieved him. Therefore, the curse of Allah be upon the unbelievers!",

In spite of the fact that it confirms the Scriptures which they already possessed and, in spite of the fact that, before it came, they used to pray for a signal victory over the disbelievers, they rejected it when it came, although they recognized it.{{95}} May Allah's curse be upon such disbelievers!",
