At any given point of time, many of those were yet unknown to man. Nor can we suppose the limits to have been reached now or that it will ever be reached at any future time.

Since this reference to God's continuing creation comes immediately after, a mention of primitive means of transport (i.e., of animals domesticated by man to this end), it-obviously relates to other - as yet unknown things of the same category: that is to say, to new means of transport which God unceasingly creates through the instrumentality of the inventiveness with which He has endowed man's mind (cf. 36:42). Inasmuch as every successive stage of human development bears witness to new, previously undreamt-of inventions in the realm of transport, the Qur'anic statement that \"He will yet create things of which [today] you have no knowledge\" is valid for every period - past, present and future - of man's history."
