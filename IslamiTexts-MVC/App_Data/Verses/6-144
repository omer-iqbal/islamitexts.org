  "ar_text_clean": "ومن الإبل اثنين ومن البقر اثنين قل آلذكرين حرم أم الأنثيين أما اشتملت عليه أرحام الأنثيين أم كنتم شهداء إذ وصاكم الله بهذا فمن أظلم ممن افترى على الله كذبا ليضل الناس بغير علم إن الله لا يهدي القوم الظالمين",
  "en_tr_yusuf": "Of camels a pair, and oxen a pair; say, hath He forbidden the two males, or the two females, or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? - Were ye present when Allah ordered you such a thing? But who doth more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead astray men without knowledge? For Allah guideth not people who do wrong.",
  "en_tr_pickth": "And of the camels twain and of the oxen twain. Say: Hath He forbidden the two males or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females contain; or were ye by to witness when Allah commanded you (all) this? Then who doth greater wrong than he who deviseth a lie concerning Allah, that he may lead mankind astray without knowledge. Lo! Allah guideth not wrongdoing folk.",
  "en_tr_shakir": "And two of camels and two of cows. Say: Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when Allah enjoined you this? Who, then, is more unjust than he who forges a lie against Allah that he should lead astray men without knowledge? Surely Allah does not guide the unjust people.",
  "en_tr_hilali": "And of the camels two (male and female), and of oxen two (male and female). Say: \"Has He forbidden the two males or the two females or (the young) which the wombs of the two females enclose? Or were you present when Allah ordered you such a thing? Then who does more wrong than one who invents a lie against Allah, to lead mankind astray without knowledge. Certainly Allah guides not the people who are Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers, etc.).\"",
  "en_tr_dbadi": "And of the camels He hath created a twain and of the oxen a twain. Say thou: is it the two males He hath forbidden or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Were ye present when Allah enjoined this on you?  Who then doth greater wrong than he who fabricateth  a lie against Allah that he may lead people astray; verily Allah shall not guide a wrong-doing people.",
  "en_tr_qarib": "Then a pair of camels and a pair of cattle. Say: 'Of these, has He forbidden you the males, the females, or what the wombs of the two females contain? Were you witnesses when Allah charged you with this? Who is more harmful than he who, without knowledge, invents a lie about Allah to mislead people? Allah does not guide the harmdoers.",
  "en_tr_ayubk": "And of camels two and of oxen two. Say, `is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when God charged you with this? Then who is more unjust than he who forges against God a lie to lead men astray without knowledge? Surely God does not guide the wrong-doing people'.",
  "en_tr_sher": "And of the camels two, and of the oxen two. Say, 'Is it the two males that He has forbidden or the two females or that which the wombs of the two females contain? Were you present when God enjoined this on you?' Who is more unjust than he who forges a lie against God that He may lead men astray without knowledge? Surely, God guides not the unjust people.",
  "en_tr_asad": "And [likewise they declare as unlawful] either of the two sexes of camels and of bovine cattle. Ask [them]: \"Is it the two males that He has forbidden, or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females may contain? Is it, perchance, that you [yourselves] were witnesses when God enjoined [all] this upon you?\" \nAnd who could be more wicked than he who, without any [real] knowledge, attributes his own lying inventions to God, and thus leads people astray? Behold, God does not grace [such] evildoing folk with His guidance.",
  "en_tr_arberry": "Of camels two, of oxen two. Say: Is it the two males He has forbidden or the two females? Or what the wombs of the two females contain? Or were you witnesses when God charged you with this? Then who does greater evil than he who forges against God a lie, in order that he may lead mankind astray without any knowledge? Surely God guides not the people of the evildoers.",
  "en_tr_maududi": "And likewise, of camels there are two, and of oxen there are two. Ask them: 'Is it either the two males that He has forbidden or the two females, or that which the wombs of the two females may contain?{{120}} Or were you present when Allah enjoined this commandment upon you?' Who, then, would be more unjust than he who fabricates a lie against Allah that he might lead people astray without knowledge. Surely Allah never guides such a wrong-doing folk.",
