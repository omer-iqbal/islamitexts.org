This double action is familiar to anyone who has seen floods on a large scale.

This phrase has been subject to several conflicting interpretations, some of which are based on no more than Talmudic legends (Manar XII, 75 f.). The most convincing explanation is that given - among others - by Tabari, Baghawi and Ibn Kathir on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas and 'Ikrimah: \"At-tannur [lit., \"oven\"] denotes the face of the earth.\" Razi, too, mentions that \"the Arabs call the face of the earth tannur\", while the Qamas gives as one of the meanings of tannur \"any place from which water gushes forth\". The verb fara which literally means \"it boiled over\" - describes the raging torrents of water which \"turned the earth into springs\" (Ibn Kathir; see also 54:12). This \"gushing forth of water over the face of the earth\" seems to point to the inundation of the huge valley now covered by the Mediterranean Sea (see surah 7, note 47) - an inundation which, augmented by continuous, torrential rains (cf. 54:11), rapidly spread over the land-mass of present-day Syria and northern 'Iraq and grew into the immense deluge described in the Bible and in the Qur'an, and also referred to in the myths of ancient Greece (e.g., in the story of Deukalion and Pyrrhea), as well as in Sumerian and Babylonian legends."
