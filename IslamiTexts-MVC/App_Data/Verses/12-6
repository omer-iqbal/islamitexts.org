      "note": "If Joseph was to be of the elect, he must understand and interpret Signs and events aright. The imagination of the pure sees truths, which those not so endowed cannot understand. The dreams of the righteous prefigure great events, while the dreams of the futile are mere idle futilities. Even things that happen to us are often like dreams. The righteous man receives disasters and reverses, not with blasphemies against Allah, but with humble devotion, seeking to ascertain His Will. Nor does he receive good fortune with arrogance, but as an opportunity for doing good, to friends and foes alike. His attitude to histories and stories is the same: he seeks the edifying material which leads to Allah."

      "note": "Lit., \"sayings\", or \"tidings\" (ahddith). Most of the commentators assume that this refers specifically to Joseph's future ability to interpret dreams; but Razi points out that in this context the term hadith (of which ahadith is the plural) may be synonymous with hadith (\"something that newly comes into existence\", i.e., \"an event\" or \"a happening\"). This is, to my mind, much more convincing than a mere reference to dream-interpretation, the more so as the term ta'wil is often used in the Qur'an (e.g., in 3:7, 10:39 or 18:78) in the sense of \"final meaning\", \"inner meaning\" or \"real meaning\" of a happening or statement or thing, as distinct from its outward, prima-facie appearance. The use of the particle min (\"of) before the term ta'wil indicates that absolute knowledge of what a thing or event implies rests with God alone (cf. 3:7 - \"none save God knows its final meaning\"), and that even God's elect, the prophets - albeit their vision is much wider than that of ordinary men - are granted only a partial insight into the mysteries of God's creation."
