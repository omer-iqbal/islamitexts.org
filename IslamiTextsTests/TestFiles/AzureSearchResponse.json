What is sleep? As far as animal life is concerned, it is the cessation of the working of the nervous system, though other animal functions, such as digestion, growth, and the circulation of the blood, continue, possibly at a different pace. It is the repose of the nervous system, and in this respect it is common to man and animals, and perhaps even to plants, if, as is probable, plants have a nervous system. The mental processes (and certainly volition) are also suspended in sleep, except that in ordinary dreams there is a medley of recollections, which often present vividly to our consciousness things that do not or cannot happen in nature as we know it in our coordinated minds. But there is another kind of dream which is rarer-one in which the dreamer sees things as they actually happen, backwards or forwards in time, or in which gifted individuals see spiritual truths otherwise imperceptible to them. How can we explain this? It is suggested that our soul or personality-that something which is above our animal life-is then in a plane of spiritual existence akin to physical death (see last note), when we are nearer to Allah.

Beyond this, however, we have here a reminder - in tune with the subsequent passages - of God's almightiness, and especially of His exclusive power to create and to withdraw life. As to the operative verb yatawaffa; it primarily denotes \\\"He takes [something] away in full\\\"; and because death is characterized by a disappearance of all vital impulses (the \\\"soul\\\") from the once-living body - their being \\\"taken away in full\\\", as it were - this form of the verb has been used tropically, since time immemorial, in the sense of \\\"causing to die\\\", and (in its intransitive form) \\\"dying\\\" or (as a noun) \\\"death\\\": a usage invariably adhered to in the Qur'an. The traditional likening of sleep to death is due to the fact that in both cases the body appears to be devoid of consciousness, partially and temporarily in the former case, and completely and permanently in the latter. (The popular translation of anfus - pi. of nafs - as \\\"souls\\\" is certainly inappropriate in the above context, since, according to the fundamental teaching of the Qur'an, man's soul does not \\\"die\\\" at the time of his bodily death but, on the contrary, lives on indefinitely. Hence, the term anfus must be rendered here as \\\"human beings\\\".)\"}" ],

      "en_notes_asad": [ "{\"note_no\":\"112\",\"note\":\"According to most of the commentators, the invisible beings (al-jinn) referred to here are the \\\"evil forces\\\" (shayatin) among them, such as are spoken of in verse 112 of this surah. It is generally assumed that these very beings or forces are addressed here; but the primary meaning of the term ma'shar appearing in this context warrants, in my opinion, a different conclusion. It is true that this term is often used to denote a group or community or genus of sentient beings which have certain characteristics in common: a conventional - and undoubtedly justifiable - use based on the verb 'asharahu, \\\"he consorted [or \\\"was on intimate terms\\\"] with him\\\" or \\\"lived in close communion with him\\\". But it is precisely this verbal origin of the term ma'shar which gives us a clue as to what is really meant here. Since, in its primary significance, a person's ma'shar denotes those who are on intimate terms or in close communion with him (cf. Lisan al-'Arab: \\\"A man's ma'shar is his family\\\"), we may well assume that it has a similar significance in the above Qur'anic phrase. Thus, to my mind, the allocution yd ma'shar al-jinn does not denote, \\\"O you community of [evil] invisible beings\\\" but, rather, \\\"O you who are [or \\\"have lived\\\"] in close communion with [evil] invisible beings\\\": in other words, it is addressed to the misguided human beings - who have been seduced by \\\"glittering half-truths meant to delude the mind\\\" (verse 112). This interpretation is reinforced by the words, \\\"Have there not come unto you apostles from among yourselves\\\", occurring in verse 130 below: for the Qur'an speaks always only of apostles who belonged to the human race, and never of apostles from among the jinn. (As regards the wide significance of this latter term, see Appendix III.)\"}", "{\"note_no\":\"113\",\"note\":\"I.e., close to the evil invisible beings.

Some of the great Muslim theologians conclude from the above and from the similar phrase occurring in 11:107 (as well as from several well-authenticated sayings of the Prophet) that - contrary to the bliss of paradise, which will be of unlimited duration - the suffering of the sinners in the life to come will be limited by God's mercy.
